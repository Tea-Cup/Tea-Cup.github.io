It was not yet evening. The day still lingered, golden and long, and Cadere could hardly believe how much she had managed to do. It was almost miraculous, she thought - how quickly work could be done when one actually had purpose.
Reaching the final stretch between the two rooms felt like crossing some invisible finish line, and the small triumph filled her chest with a quiet sort of pride. For the first time in a long while, she felt like she was getting somewhere.
Of course, fast work also meant fast hunger. Her stomach reminded her of that with a soft grumble, and she smiled, patting it absently. Funny - she never used to feel hungry around this time before. Maybe because she had never earned her hunger quite like this.
Now, the question was... where would she get food?
Before, it had always come directly from Daemii-sama's hand, though that had been early on - when she was still new, still helpless. Was it proper now, she wondered, to approach her master herself? It didn't seem right to interrupt. Daemii-sama was always busy, always working on something at the cavern's entrance.
Still, Cadere's excitement got the better of her. She just had to tell someone about what she'd done - and who better than the one who gave her the task in the first place? She'd go boast a little, she decided. Like a child running to her mother, though she tried not to think of it that way.
As she crossed the corridor, the sight of Daemii-sama's crimson brought her to an instinctive halt. Cadere straightened herself, brushed off her skirt, and took a deep breath to calm her giddy energy. She wanted to seem composed - a diligent maid reporting her progress, not some scatterbrained girl.
Quietly, she circled to her master's side so she wouldn't need to turn around. That seemed more respectful.
Then she saw what Daemii-sama was doing.
Sitting at the edge of the dry basin, the fox was weaving something in the air - an immaculate tapestry made of fine red threads that shimmered and floated without any support. It was unlike anything Cadere had ever seen. The threads drifted, tightened, looped through one another, and held together as if the air itself obeyed her will.
Cadere forgot all about her reason for coming. She simply stood there, mouth slightly open, staring.
Khara continued her work in silence, unbothered, her fingers moving with impossible precision until, finally, she tightened one knot and rested her hands on her lap.
Cadere didn't notice. Her eyes followed the shifting lines, tracing the pattern with growing wonder.
Only when Daemii-sama turned her head slightly did the girl stir - though not because of the gaze. Another string appeared to the side, and when Khara plucked it, the air shimmered. Cadere's vision sparkled, flashing with scattered color. She blinked rapidly, startled, taking a few steps back.
By the time her senses cleared, the fox was looking straight at her.
"Ah! I-I'm sorry!" Cadere bowed quickly, almost losing her balance.
"Well?" Khara's tone was even. "What is it?"
"Ah, I came to, um... to inform you that I've cleaned two rooms now," Cadere managed.
"Did you?" Khara tilted her head slightly. "So you came for a headpat and a 'good job'?"
"Uh-well... I just wanted to confirm," Cadere mumbled, fidgeting with her fingers. "And, um, maybe ask for something for that?"
The fox's expression didn't change - perfectly indifferent.
"I suppose you can," she said at last, blinking slowly. "Speak your wish."
"Uhm... to better perform the task you gave me, could I ask for a mop? Or at least some fabric to make one?"
Khara repeated the word like it was foreign to her. "A... mop." She sighed softly. "I was hoping for something more imaginative. It seems I must lower my expectations."
Her gaze drifted to the shaft of sunlight spilling from the cavern's ceiling.
"And... may I also make a second wish?" Cadere asked, hopeful again.
"A second?" Khara turned back, one brow raised.
"I... did clean two rooms," Cadere said, tilting her head to the side, attempting a smile.
"How greedy," the fox murmured, though her tone softened. "Speak."
"Could I have some food?"
There was a brief silence, then Khara blinked once - slowly, almost in disbelief.
"I will feed you," she said finally, shaking her head with a small exhale. "Speak another one."
Cadere blinked, startled. "Ah-uhm... really? Then, may I have... another set of clothes?"
"You will receive them, elf." Khara's lips curved faintly, amused. "You'll find them in your room. I'll visit later."
Cadere bowed deeply, beaming. "Thank you very much, Master!"
She held the bow for several seconds, then straightened and walked back into the castle.
This time, her steps were measured, graceful - but her gait had a faint, undeniable spring to it.
