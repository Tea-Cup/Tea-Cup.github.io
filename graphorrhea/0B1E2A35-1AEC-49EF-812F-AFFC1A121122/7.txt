Cadere walked back toward the castle, this time watching the walls and ceiling with new attention. The scale of her task began to dawn on her. To clean this place - to banish centuries of dust and ruin - would take a lifetime, perhaps several. The thought pressed on her chest, faintly suffocating, yet it was a purpose nonetheless.
A strange comfort lingered in that: that her second life, however unnatural, had been given shape.
Still, she wondered if she had understood her master's words correctly. Had Khara meant "respect" in tone, or something deeper - something felt rather than spoken? No tool had been granted when she left the cavern. Khara had only gestured for her to return and "begin."
Was she expected to start with bare hands? With scraps of cloth for rags?
These thoughts circled her mind until she stepped into her room - and stopped.
The space was brighter than before. Not merely from daylight, but from something else.
Lifting her gaze from the ever-present layer of dust, Cadere found a new addition beside her bed: a lantern.
It hung neatly from a small metal hook now embedded in the stone wall - something that certainly had not been there before. Was this the tool Daemii-sama had spoken of?
It looked familiar at first glance, shaped like an ornate oil lamp, but inside there was no flame. Instead, a soft orange light came from a narrow line that ran vertically through the glass cylinder. Thin metallic fins wrapped around it like petals of a strange flower, guiding the glow outward.
She lifted it carefully from the hook. It was light in her hands. At the base, a small lever traced a circular path; turning it made the fins close and open, dimming or brightening the light. There was no slot for oil, no flint, no scent of smoke.
Was it... unfueled?
Cadere frowned, running her thumb along the smooth metal. She had no understanding of such craftsmanship. Perhaps, she thought, it did not require tending - perhaps it simply was.
Then something else caught her eye. In the shadow where the lantern had hung, another object rested on the same hook: a straight wooden stick, roughly her own height. A thin linen cord was wrapped loosely around its surface, offering grip where there was no other ornament.
She lifted it down. It was plain - polished smooth, balanced, and utterly ordinary. No runes, no markings. Just wood.
"A stick," she murmured. "Or... a wand?"
Holding it yielded no revelation. She turned it over once more, then leaned it gently against the wall beside the bed.
The lantern, though - that she understood. It did something.
Setting it on the chair, she studied its glow with quiet awe. The light was warm, orange like a hearthfire, yet it neither burned nor flickered. Whatever invisible filament pulsed within, it gave steady illumination - like captured dawn itself.
Cadere smiled faintly. With this, the darkness could no longer keep her confined. She no longer needed to wait for morning to see what lay beyond.
Taking the lantern in hand, she stepped out into the hall and began to ascend the left stairway to the second floor - the one filled with blind corridors she had not dared enter before.
Now, as she walked, the darkness parted before her.
The corridors revealed themselves one by one, long-forgotten chambers and branching paths unfolding beneath her quiet steps. The map in her mind began to expand - no longer lines of uncertainty, but places taking form in the glow of the orange light.
And for the first time since her rebirth, Cadere felt something faintly like anticipation.
Through the narrow tunnels of stone and brick, Cadere wandered - her lamp throwing long, uneven shadows that quivered along the walls. She passed through a series of forgotten rooms, some collapsed into rubble, others strangely intact. One, however, drew her notice: its door did not crumble at her touch. It only groaned, heavy and ancient, as she pushed it open. The hinges protested but held.
Inside was little - dust, silence, and another doorway, this one broken in half upon the floor. From beyond that splintered frame seeped a thin ray of light, faint and trembling, as though the sun itself hesitated to intrude. Stepping carefully over the fallen wood, she followed it, and there, in the upper corner of the chamber, found a hole.
It startled her. Never before had she seen the stonework of the castle damaged. For a moment she simply stood there, staring, until the unease gathered in her chest like cold water. What if - she thought - this breach was no longer part of the Domain Daemii-sama spoke of? What if it led back to the world beyond, the one she had once died in?
The memory of that death lingered like a phantom ache. She did not wish to feel that fading again. Still, curiosity urged her forward. She approached the hole slowly, one cautious step at a time, ready to leap back should her vision dim or the world tilt as it had before. But nothing happened. The air held. Her pulse remained steady. She reached up - and touched grass.
Living grass.
Her breath caught. It was the first living thing she had touched since death, and the realization made her hand tremble. The blades were long, coarse, thick - unlike the soft meadow grasses she remembered. These were resilient, holding their shape against her palm. She stroked them carefully, feeling the stubborn stiffness, the faint waxy edge, the quiet life.
It occurred to her that such grass could make a fine broom.
She blinked, surprised at herself - but the thought stuck. She already had a stick, perfectly sized, and a coil of rope she had found earlier. Yes, that would do. The idea filled her with an odd warmth, as though she had discovered something meaningful, something hers.
Setting down the lamp, she reached higher into the hole, tugging loose a handful of blades. They snapped free with a dry sound. She gathered another, then another, until she had a modest bundle. There was still plenty left hanging, and the light filtering through the grass seemed brighter now, cleaner. Satisfied, she gathered her stiff green bouquet and carried it back through the corridors.
The walk was filled with small, uncertain thoughts. How was a broom actually made? Did one dry the grass first? Or use some other kind of plant? She had used brooms countless times, yet could not recall ever seeing one made. The gaps in her memory pressed faintly at her temples, but she brushed them aside.
When she returned to her room, she laid the grass upon the floor, fetched her stick, and uncoiled the rope. Placing the stalks in a neat layer, she set the stick upon them and began wrapping, turning, tightening, pulling until the rope creaked. When she lifted it for inspection, the result looked... strange. The broom's base flared wildly, its grass pointing in all directions like a startled bird.
She frowned, then laughed softly to herself. "Too bushy," she murmured, undoing the work.
Her second attempt went better. She aligned the blades carefully, laid each layer flat against the last, then bound them together more deliberately. The shape held firm. When she lifted it this time, it looked - almost right.
A sense of quiet pride swelled in her chest. She had made something. With her own hands. The thought made her smile, small and hesitant but real.
It was still only a grass broom, of course - but no matter.
"Ahh," she said aloud, tilting her head with mock gravity, "no use moping about a mop."
Then she laughed again, holding her creation upright like a banner. "How resourceful of me," she said, and her voice echoed faintly through the empty halls - half amusement, half affirmation, and wholly alive.
