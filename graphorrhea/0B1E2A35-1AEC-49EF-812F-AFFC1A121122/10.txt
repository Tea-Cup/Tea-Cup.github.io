Cadere's exploration that day brought her little satisfaction. Beyond the corridor where her lantern's light had flickered and died, she found nothing but more empty rooms - bare walls, hollow echoes, and silence thick enough to press on her thoughts. How could any place be so barren? The absence itself felt alive, as if the castle had long ago forgotten the idea of being lived in. The emptiness eroded her curiosity, and soon she found herself wandering without purpose, the lantern's steady orange glow mocking her with how little it revealed.
She reasoned, eventually, that nothing more useful would come of searching. The only thing worth doing was the one task she had been given. Sweeping. Without water, that was all she could manage.
So she returned to the hall, retrieved her broom, and climbed the stairs to the room she had marked earlier, one filled with rotting wood and debris. Setting the lantern at its center, Cadere took a breath and began her work.
At first, it was all confusion. The broom caught on splinters and loose fragments, dust rose in choking clouds. But once she cleared space enough to move, rhythm appeared. She began to think in systems - dividing the room into sectors, sweeping one after another, pushing debris toward the door, merging small piles into greater ones. Her movements steadied, her thoughts quieted. The act of cleaning became almost meditative.
By the time she finished, light from the high window had shifted from gold to the soft pink of dawn. She carried the final pile outside and leaned against the stone balcony, breathing deep, her chest heavy but satisfied. The air was still, and for a moment, she thought the room behind her looked brighter, cleaner somehow, even if the dust still clung to the corners.
Then, turning back to glance into the main hall below, her faint smile vanished.
Her master was there.
The fox sat leisurely upon the throne, one leg crossed over the other, a few fruits held lazily in her hands. The wooden chair by the throne - Cadere's chair - was already facing her.
Cadere inhaled sharply, seized her lantern, and hurried down the stairs.
"Good work today," Khara said, her voice warmer than usual, though her expression remained unreadable. "Have a seat."
Cadere obeyed, setting the lantern by her feet.
"Done with one room already?"
"Mostly," Cadere replied, lowering her eyes. "I still don't have a way to deal with the dust..."
"You don't?" Khara tilted her head slightly, then tossed one of the fruits her way. "I thought you made a broom."
"I did," Cadere said, catching it awkwardly. "But it only lifts the dust into the air. Without water, I can't move it anywhere."
"Water, you say..." Khara bit into her own fruit, juice dripping freely from it. "You went to the far tower today, hm?"
"I'm not sure if it was the far, or even a tower," Cadere admitted, recalling her route. "But it was quite a walk."
"Well, that's not where water would be," Khara mused, slurping another bite. "It should be underground."
Cadere blinked. Underground? Did her master expect her to dig now?
Khara waved a hand lazily. "Still, you did clean a room. That deserves something, I suppose."
The conversation faded into the slow rhythm of chewing and slurping. Khara ate with no particular urgency, but Cadere devoured hers quickly, hunger returning to her as if newly remembered. Khara noticed, of course, and passed her another fruit with its outer shell already cracked open.
Inside, the flesh was pale and strangely salty, its texture dense like meat. Cadere chewed thoughtfully, wondering if anyone among the living had ever tasted it. The shell was hard, almost like stone, yet her master had split it with ease.
Maybe it's a kind of nut, she thought absently. Do nuts even grow in jungles?
Her mind drifted to foolish questions until the faint sound of footsteps drew her attention. She looked up just as Khara's hand came to rest gently atop her head - briefly, almost absently - as the fox passed her to leave.
Cadere froze, startled by the touch. When she turned, Khara was already walking toward the cavern, tail swaying lazily behind her.
"T-thank you for the meal!" Cadere stood up and called after her, remembering her manners.
"Good night," came the reply, casual and soft, with only a wave of the hand.
Cadere's gaze lingered on the tail - its vivid red glow, its softness she could almost imagine beneath her fingertips. It must feel so warm, she thought. Then, embarrassed by herself, she shook her head. No, no... that's disrespectful.
Was it blasphemy to think that way? Did blasphemy even apply to someone like Khara? Was she a god? Cadere didn't know. The thought lingered longer than she wanted it to.
She returned to her room in silence, hung the lantern by her bed, and changed into her sleeping clothes. Her "work clothes" lay folded on the chair - her one small act of order.
Lying down, she exhaled. The day replayed behind her eyelids: the sweeping, the fruit, the brief warmth of her master's hand. Then her mind drifted to older things - memories that grew hazy the harder she reached for them.
Her home... yes, there had been one. A small house, she thought. With windows. Maybe a fence, or maybe not. Fields? No - forest. Or hills. The faces of those she once knew blurred into nothing.
‹Am I forgetting more with time?› she wondered. ‹Or did death simply take the rest?›
A yawn overtook her, her eyes tearing slightly from its force. The effort of remembering felt heavy.
Thinking is tiring, she thought dimly. Better to rest.
She turned the lantern's fins, dimming its light to nothing. Darkness enveloped her - soft, gentle, complete. The air was warm enough that she didn't need to hide beneath the sheets.
‹Yes,› she thought faintly as her mind drifted. ‹This is how an afterlife should feel.›
Then, just before sleep claimed her, another thought crossed her mind - quiet, foolish, almost childish.
‹Still... I'd like more pillows.›
