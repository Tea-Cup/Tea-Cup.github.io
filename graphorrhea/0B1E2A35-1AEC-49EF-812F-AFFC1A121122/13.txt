It took Cadere nearly an hour to properly warm up after her mischief with the bucket. It was still early in the day, and though she tried, she couldn't fall asleep again. Instead, she simply lay there, soaking in the new sensations that still lingered in her body. When she finally got up, the air in the room felt much warmer. Maybe it was the heat of the day, or maybe her body was still cold from before.
It was the first time she truly felt like she was in a jungle - if this place could even be called that. Jungles were supposed to be hot, right? She had never actually been in one, so she wasn't sure.
Her gaze fell to the crumpled maid uniform lying at the edge of the bed. With a smirk, she muttered, "Well, can't be naked all the time," and slipped it on. It wasn't exactly the sort of clothing she would have chosen for herself, but given the lack of alternatives, it was better than nothing.
Then she remembered the bucket of water still waiting beside the bed. Crouching down, she cupped a handful and drank slowly. It wasn't cold anymore - just pleasantly cool. A small refreshment, but it felt good.
Grabbing the bucket in one hand and the lantern in the other, she climbed upstairs to the room she had cleared of rubble the day before. The piles of wooden fragments and chips greeted her at the door, exactly where she had left them.
She had hoped they might have mysteriously vanished overnight, but clearly that was too hopeful. Without sighing, she stepped into the dusty room. She didn't have a mop, so - no time like the present to improvise.
Setting the lantern outside the doorway for now, she swung the bucket in a wide arc, splashing water across the room. A shallow puddle spread over the floor, quickly soaking up the dust. Robbed of its ability to drift in the air, it could now be swept into piles - that was the plan.
The lantern wasn't a real flame, though... right? She moved it to the middle of the room, just for better light.
As she swept and kicked through the puddles, the light reflected off the wet floor, painting the walls and ceiling with slow, dancing patterns. Her odd method actually worked better than expected - the soaked dust clumped together into heavy, dark masses, turning from weightless motes into something she could scoop and shove.
The water was nearly black now, thick and dirty. Cadere hadn't thought that far ahead - what exactly was she supposed to do with it? By the time she'd cleared half the room and water began spilling into the hallway, she decided it was time to pause and reconsider.
Maybe next time she'd use less water.
For now, she tried soaking some of it up with the pile of wood chips. It was backwards and inefficient, but it helped a little. The wood drank up the worst of the puddle.
Ah well - the first attempt couldn't be perfect.
She wasn't even upset about the mess she'd made in her attempt to clean up. If anything, it felt like progress. The dust was gone, and that was enough of a victory for her. The soggy chips could be dealt with later; the rest would dry eventually.
Propping the broom against the wall, she started collecting the larger fragments into the bucket. A little change of pace after the messy mopping. Her plan was to toss them out of the tower window, but when she got there, she hesitated.
The smaller chips had been useful - maybe the bigger ones would be too. Not like she had an infinite supply of wood here, and she wouldn't be able to get them back once thrown away.
So instead, she carried them up the tower and dumped them there for later. Who knew - maybe she'd find a use for them.
She made a few trips like that until only the damp pile of chips remained. By then, the wood had absorbed much of the remaining water, bloating up slightly. They weren't any lighter, nor was the floor dry, but at least now she could move the rest of the mess out of the room.
Using her broom more like a bad rake, she pushed the last clumps out into the hall. When she was done, the room looked cleaner than it probably had in centuries. With the still-wet broom, she went along the corners and seams of the floor, finishing her work.
This was now officially her first clear room.
Cadere stood there for a moment, hands on hips, chest swelling with quiet pride. Even with the lamp still glowing in the center, the place no longer felt gloomy or dead. The uncovered floor turned out to be made of pale stone - bright, almost warm in color - and the whole room seemed to come alive with it.
It looked so much better, she even considered moving in. But after a moment of thought, she decided to clean her current room instead.
Returning with another bucket of water, she grabbed the bedframe and tried to move it out of the way. It barely budged, and the protesting creak of its old wood made her stop before she broke it.
So she pulled off the sheets, folded them as best she could, and placed them neatly on the chair she'd left in the hall. With the bed stripped, she managed to flip the frame on its side and lean it against the wall.
It would have to be a two-part job, but that was fine.
Pouring out just a bit of water this time, she swept the puddle along the floor. The black wave of dust thickened quickly into a strange, pasty sludge - too much grime built up over time. She rinsed the broom in the bucket, then went over the corners and cracks once more, until clean stone peeked through.
Setting the bed back down and moving it slightly from the wall, she repeated the process for the last hidden stretch.
When she finally stopped, she looked around and smiled. The pile of soggy chips was still upstairs, the wooden fragments still sat in the tower, and a puddle of dirty water still lingered outside her door... but who cared?
The room was clean.
She couldn't help but hum, the tune low and content, as she admired the brightness that now filled her space.
It was strange - she hadn't realized how heavy the dust had felt until it was gone. The air seemed lighter, the colors more vivid. The room was clean, and somehow, her world felt cleaner too.
