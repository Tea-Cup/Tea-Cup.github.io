A sound followed - a gasp.
A ragged, desperate gasp for air, as if pulled from the depths of drowning.
The elf girl's eyes flew open. She lay there, chest heaving, her lungs grasping for life. Gradually her breath steadied. She dared not move, hardly believing the rhythm of it - inhale, exhale, the soft blink of eyelids.
Alive.
For a time she could only lie there, staring up at the gray ceiling, unwilling to believe it. She had prayed for death long before it came. Captured by that monstrous woman, dragged through the endless jungle, cut and bitten by the wilds - it had been a torment without end. She had resisted once, but resistance had brought her only pain. So she had stopped. She had prayed for a clean death.
And now - she was here.
The surface beneath her felt strange: flat, faintly soft, not the tangled roots or rough bark she had grown used to. The air was still. No buzzing insects, no growling beasts. Chiseled stone framed her vision.
Perhaps I died after all, she thought. Perhaps this is the afterlife I prayed for.
For a long while she did not move, listening to the faint sounds of wind through faraway leaves. When at last she turned her head, she saw a chair standing in the center of the room. Upon it lay a folded bundle of black and white fabric. Beyond it - an open doorway, leading to more hewn stone.
She lifted one hand, then the other. Her wrists were unbound.
Tentatively, she brushed the side of her head where memory whispered of pain. She felt nothing but smooth skin and fine hair. Looking down, she found herself dressed in plain white sleepwear - soft fabric that was certainly not her own.
It was absurd, but perhaps that was the nature of death.
Gathering her strength - oddly, she found she had plenty - she sat up. Her bare feet met cold stone. The sensation grounded her. She scanned the small room again: nothing but the bed, the chair, the folded garments.
Drawn by curiosity, she approached the chair. The garments were unmistakable - a maid's uniform, simple and practical, without frills. A white apron, puffed shoulders, a dark skirt that reached the knees. It was plain, but finely made; the cloth soft and tailored to her size.
She changed into them. The fabric hugged her gently, perfectly. She even smiled, faintly, at how right they felt - though she wished there were a mirror to confirm she had worn them properly.
With hesitant steps, she moved toward the doorway.
The hall beyond was bright with sunlight streaming from the right, illuminating dust motes that swam like golden pollen. She saw the great throne beneath the tall window, and the vast, empty space around it.
Still barefoot, she walked across the dusty floor until she reached one of the great columns that supported the balcony. Touching it, she felt the rough grit of age beneath her palm. When she looked down, her feet were already darkened by dust, her footprints clear behind her.
There were no others. She was alone.
The realization brought her courage.
She walked into the center of the hall, looking around. There was little to see beyond the light, the throne, and the long rows of doors. Most were closed and ancient, their wood sagging with rot. Yet beyond them, she sensed - something. Rooms, perhaps. Secrets.
But one opening drew her eye: the great passage that stretched far ahead, lined with smooth stone. At its distant end, faint light shimmered - sunlight, perhaps, or freedom.
She turned her face toward it, gathered the folds of her skirt, and began to walk.
As she timidly advanced down the corridor, the girl began to doubt it was an exit at all. Yet something stirred at the far end - a glint of color in this world of gray and white. Red.
The closer she came, the more it took shape - a mound of red, motionless yet alive. Then it moved. Like the flick of a flame, the red shifted from one side to the other, and two crimson peaks rose above it. The red had noticed her.
The girl froze. What was it? Was it dangerous? Would it kill her?
Then she remembered - she had already died. What more could it do? And so she continued forward, her pace hesitant, her breath shallow.
Step by step, the shape resolved. The red strands were hair - impossibly long, flowing like liquid fire. The flicker she had mistaken for flame was a tail. The twin peaks were ears. It was a woman - a creature both divine and foxlike, seated at the edge of a basin, her hands deep in clay. She was shaping something - a small figure, a doll of earth.
The girl stopped, transfixed. That face... she remembered a flash of red before her death. Perhaps it was this same being. She stood still, hands clasped at her chest, watching as the woman molded the doll's face with infinite patience.
Time moved unnoticed. Only when the girl's heart had quieted did she dare speak.
"Am I-"
The woman's hands froze mid-motion. Her eyes turned sharply toward the girl, though her head did not move. The girl's breath caught at the sudden acknowledgment. The silence lingered until she forced the words out.
"Am I... dead?"
The woman regarded her for a long moment before answering.
"Your life was severed and no longer belongs to this world," she said at last, her tone calm yet absolute. She paused, lowering her head slightly. "Yet it did not end. It now belongs to me."
Her voice was unlike anything the girl had known - ancient, serene, and final, like the elder of her village who once spoke of gods and the afterlife. It both answered and deepened every question at once.
The girl swallowed. "Who... are you?"
"I am Khara Daemii," the woman replied, her red eyes unblinking. "The Soul in rest."
