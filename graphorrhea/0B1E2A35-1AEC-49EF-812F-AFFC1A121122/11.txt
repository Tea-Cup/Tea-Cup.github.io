The night passed without meaning.
Cadere had been awake for some time but kept her eyes shut, hoping sleep might take her again. It didn't, so she lay still, pretending it could, though she knew that dream was done. Staying in bed was the only rebellion she had left - a refusal to meet another day she never asked for. Eventually, the futility of it won, and she sat up.
Waking wasn't hard because she was tired - it was hard because it didn't feel real. The hours between rising and rest blended into something dreamlike, too empty to be called life. The castle around her was gray and hollow, walls whispering with echoes that went nowhere. It didn't need her. None of this did.
So what was the point of getting up at all?
Maybe her master wanted her to. Maybe this endless cleaning was meant as mercy, or mockery - she couldn't tell. Khara made her sweep and dust for no reason, but perhaps even gods needed something to laugh at. Was she a savior or a warden? A spirit or a demon? Did such lines even matter when you were already dead?
Cadere used to think she was a good person. She remembered vague shapes - helping hands, polite words, something like kindness. None of it mattered now. Whatever her life was, it had been stripped of meaning the moment she arrived here, and this afterlife, if that's what it was, had even less. She couldn't even end it herself.
The sunlight creeping through the doorway mocked her. Warm and golden, it spilled over the stone, painting the place in colors too alive for her. She reached for the lamp and flicked it open, watching the dull orange glow spread across her room. That light felt closer to her mood - quiet, worn, made to serve. ‹The lamp had it worse,› she thought. ‹It could only ever burn when told to.›
Her eyes drifted toward the chair where her clothes rested, neatly folded, obedient. Next to it sat a wooden bucket bound in metal. A "reward," maybe. She almost laughed at that. ‹More work for good work. Of course.›
She stood, her body swaying as if gravity itself had grown heavier overnight. Pulling the sleepwear off over her head, she let it fall wherever it wanted. The lamplight painted her naked skin in soft orange, but it was just light on stone - lifeless. She stretched, back cracking faintly, and let out a slow breath that sounded more like resignation than relief.
She looked at the uniform on the chair, but couldn't bring herself to put it on. She'd lost interest in playing the servant. Throwing it on the bed and picking up the chair, she meant to carry it out with her, but then noticed the bucket wasn't empty. Inside, on a broad green leaf, lay a small piece of meat still clinging to bone. A meal, then. She sighed and decided to bring that too.
The tower wasn't far - the one with the open window where she'd fallen once. She walked there quietly, her bare feet brushing the cold floor, until she reached the place and set the chair before the view. The world outside was vivid and impossibly alive. She sat, heavy and slow, and set the bucket on her knees.
The meal looked... edible, at least. Some kind of small creature, with dark blue berries nestled beside it. She stared for a moment, unsure if she should even care whether it was safe, then put one of the berries in her mouth. It was sour, soft, and made the roof of her mouth feel rough. The meat smelled faintly cooked but was cold, tough. Bird, maybe. She chewed without tasting.
When the skin refused her bite, she threw it out the window, watching it vanish into green. The rest went down easier. It wasn't bad. Not amazing either. Just something to do with her mouth while her mind drifted elsewhere.
The jungle moved in slow, quiet ways. Leaves rustled, shadows leapt, some distant creature called out into the vastness. Life carried on, utterly indifferent to her. She watched until her thoughts blurred. The bone in her hand was bare by the time she noticed her body's quiet reminder of need - an ache she had no patience for. She tossed the bone aside, looked at the wide empty leaf, and muttered in resignation:
"...I need to find water."
Her voice carried no urgency. Just the tired acceptance of another small task in a world that wouldn't end.
