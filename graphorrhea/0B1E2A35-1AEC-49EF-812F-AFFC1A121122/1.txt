In the ancient jungle, where human presence was not welcome - indeed, where it was met with hostility - stood a castle embedded in the face of a cliff, swallowed by green. Moss and grass carpeted its walls, and the canopy above concealed it from the heavens. Though long abandoned, it was no ruin; its form endured with quiet dignity, untouched since times beyond the reach of history.
It was almost unthinkable that a nation capable of such masonry had ever existed in so wild a place, where even soil lay buried beneath tangled roots and ancient grass. Yet the castle remained - solemn, enduring, and curiously unclaimed. No beast dared make it a lair, for the stronghold still held a single inhabitant.
The legend of the jungle castle was never written, passed only by tongue: whispers of a goddess, an angel, or perhaps a spirit dwelling deep within the forbidden green. To reach it was perilous - a journey that tested endurance and will - but one hero, for lack of a better word, sought it out to feed her boundless desire for legend.
She was a dark elf warrior, a woman who had crossed much of the civilized world challenging men of renown, seeking one who could best her in martial skill. Yet none could. And so, unsatisfied, she turned her gaze toward the supernatural. Surely no mortal could stand against her - only a being of myth might.
To appease such a spirit, she brought a sacrifice: a young light elf girl she had captured along the way. The abduction posed no difficulty for her; few dared defy her, and none had lived long enough to try twice. But keeping the captive alive through the trek proved harder. Bound and fragile, the girl was little more than a burden the warrior could not abandon. Living off fruit and what game she could catch, the warrior pressed onward, her vigilance unbroken by day or night.
At last, she came upon a cavernous opening in a lonely cliff. The surrounding lands were gentle hills and endless trees - no mountains for leagues - so this sheer face of rock stood like a wound in the earth, hidden only by the forest's shroud. Legends spoke of a lone castle built upon such a cliff, and now she saw it with her own eyes. Triumphant, she entered the shadowed mouth, dragging the exhausted captive beside her.
The cavern within was dimly lit by a single shaft of light from above. A broad, hollow chamber opened before her - a basin of stone, as if a lake had once lain there and vanished. Around its edge rose a stony coast, two meters high, enclosing an expanse perhaps twenty across. Two tunnels marked its ends: one, raw and jagged, leading back into the wild; the other, carved and ordered, framed in weathered stone - the entrance to the rumored castle.
There was no grass, no moss, no creeping vine - only stone.
And there, upon the stony ledge beside the carved gate, sat a figure.
The figure could, at a glance, be mistaken for a beast - were it not for the subdued hue of garments unmistakably wrought by human hands. Upon its head of crimson stood a pair of sharp, alert ears, towering above a face too deliberate to belong to any animal.
It was a visage carved for war: eyes like the points of spears, a nose fine and perilous as a dagger's edge, lips like blades still moist with blood - set upon a chin of geometric precision. It was a face that seemed less born than forged, promising death with a glance alone.
The figure did not speak. It sat motionless, watchful, draped in what seemed to be an ancient ceremonial garment. Its long hair pooled around it like spilled shadow, spilling into the dry basin below - a phantom's river of carnage.
The heroine knew, with the certainty of instinct, that this was no beast.
The cliff. The castle. The guardian.
The legend was true.
Straightening her back, she declared:
"I am the hero of the lands. I have come to seek the granting of my wish!"
The figure did not stir.
"I desire life," she continued, her voice hard with pride, "and so I offer life in exchange!"
At that, she thrust her captive forward. The bound elf stumbled and fell to her knees beside her. The figure's head tilted, its gaze sharp as an arrowpoint.
"Having walked all lands," the heroine proclaimed, mistaking silence for attention, "I have found no man capable of defeating me. Among all those I've slain, none were worthy to carry my bloodline. Since no mortal soul may inherit my legacy, I demand a child with the immortal! Will you grant me my wish?"
A long silence followed. Then the figure's lips - those thin crimson blades - curved wider, and parted.
"Demand, huh?" the voice said. It was soft, almost gentle, yet it devoured every sound in the chamber.
"It will be granted."
Hearing the words she longed for, the hero pushed the elf girl into the basin. The captive gave a single sharp cry as she fell. Her body struck stone with a dull, final thud and lay still.
The figure's eyes flicked toward the fallen offering, then back to the warrior. The faint smirk vanished.
A heartbeat later, the heroine felt heat bloom within her abdomen - an alien vibration, searing from the inside. She clenched her jaw, trying to stand against it, but the pain grew unbearable. It burned, spread, and then gathered deep within her belly, where she could only imagine her womb to be.
An eternity - or perhaps a minute - passed before the agony ebbed. Sweat ran down her face as she gasped for air, trembling and hollow.
"Now begone," said the figure.
And she obeyed. There was nothing left to say.
Her wish, she thought, must have been granted - though not in any form she had ever envisioned.
The sacrifice remained where it fell, unmoving, empty-eyed.
