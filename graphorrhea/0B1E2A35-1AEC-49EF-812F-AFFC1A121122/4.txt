The girl woke a few hours later. After her miraculous resurrection, she was left overwhelmed by the meeting with her new, self-proclaimed master. The woman who called herself Khara had not answered many questions - she had only created new ones. Their exchange was brief; Khara dismissed her, telling her to grow accustomed to the place.
The girl returned to the bed where she had first awakened, trying to calm her thoughts. Her memories were spotty - not gone, but polished, as if someone had smoothed the edges away. She remembered having parents and siblings, their laughter, their kindness - yet could no longer recall their faces. Their names, the name of her home, even the color of her own eyes eluded her. It was all there, somewhere, like a statue eroded by centuries of rain: the shape remained, but all detail had dissolved.
It should have frightened her, but it didn't. The absence felt natural, not imposed. She could not tell if those memories were truly hers, but neither did they feel false. For hours she lay there, turning that thought over and over, trying to decide how she should feel about it - until her stomach made the decision for her.
If she was alive - if this could be called life - then she still had to eat. But where would she find food in this place? The stone halls and dust seemed utterly devoid of sustenance.
When she stepped out again, the sun was sinking, its light stretching pink across the gray walls. Soon, darkness would fill the place. There were no lamps, no torches, not even sconces for them.
She approached the nearest door. The wood was cracked and half-detached from its hinges. A gentle push sent it toppling inward, breaking apart in a burst of dust. Coughing, she waved the air clear. The room beyond was empty - bare stone, thick dust, nothing else.
So she crossed the hall to another door, choosing it on a whim. This time she tried to lift and pull it aside, hoping to avoid another collapse. The brittle wood gave way in her hands anyway, splintering into fragments at her feet. But the dust cloud was smaller, and she pressed on.
Inside, she found a larger chamber - a stone hearth with a chimney, a heavy stone table in the center, and the crumbled remnants of wood stacked along one wall. A kitchen, perhaps, long dead. Only stone had endured; everything else had rotted to powder.
At the far end was another doorway, leading into darkness. She stepped closer, peering into it  - 
"Save exploration for daytime."
The girl froze.
Khara stood in the doorway, watching her. In one hand she held a cluster of fruit - deep red, impossibly fresh against the desolate gray.
"I'm not stopping you. You can go wherever you wish in the castle."
Khara's face remained still, her tone perfectly even - neither amused nor kind. "You can figure it all out when the sun is properly out."
She extended her hand, holding a small round fruit. With a faint shake and a soft click of her tongue - like calling a cat - she motioned toward the girl. The absurdity of the gesture startled the girl out of her fear. She lowered her gaze, bowing slightly as she accepted the fruit with both hands.
"Come," Khara said, turning toward the hall's center. "At least sit when eating."
The girl followed, clutching the fruit carefully. As they neared the stone throne, a loud scrape echoed through the hall - the sound of wood dragging across stone. The chair from her room slid forward on its own, stopping at a respectful distance from the throne. Khara seated herself without concern for the thick layer of dust, reclining slightly in the ancient seat, and bit into one of her own fruits.
She chewed slowly, watching the girl in silence.
"Eat," she said at last, motioning with her half-eaten fruit.
The girl hesitated, then took a small bite. At once, juice burst across her tongue - tart and sweet, sharp enough to make her flinch. But hunger overtook caution. She bit again, and again, until her hands and lips were wet with juice. The taste was strange but vivid - bitter skin, sweet pulp, a lingering tang of earth and life.
Her master said nothing, simply observing with an unreadable calm as the girl devoured every piece until only a hard, knotted core remained.
"Here."
Khara's voice broke the quiet as she tossed another fruit. The girl fumbled, dropped the seed, caught the fruit, and bit into it immediately. This one was drier, crisp like an apple with a faint acidity.
"By now," Khara began, "I assume you've realized."
The girl froze mid-chew.
"Your memories," Khara continued. "Your life."
"I don't remember much..." the girl admitted softly.
"The memories you retain are no longer exactly yours," Khara said, her tone patient but distant. "The soul that came to this castle is not the same as the one sitting before me now. What you have are fragments - echoes - inherited from the pattern of what you once were."
The girl frowned, struggling to follow the meaning. It sounded like a kindness and a curse at once.
"You can think of this as an afterlife," Khara said, taking another bite. "A life after life."
"But then... what am I?" the girl asked, her voice small. "A ghost?"
"For the rest of the world, yes," Khara replied simply. Then, after a pause, "I will call you Cadere."
"Cadere? But what about my birth name?"
"Since your latest birth happened here - by my hands - you will bear the name I've given you."
"But... that's not who I am," Cadere whispered, her shoulders sinking.
"You are no longer who you were," Khara said, as if stating a law of nature.
Cadere said nothing after that. She sat quietly, chewing what remained of the fruit with little appetite, her thoughts dissolving into blankness.
When she finished, Khara rose soundlessly from the throne. She pressed the last fruit into Cadere's hands and rested her palm lightly atop the girl's head.
Then she turned and walked away - back toward the basin where they had first met.
Left alone in the vast hall, Cadere sat beneath the moonlight pouring through the great window, eating the final fruit in silence.
