Khara sat alone in the entrance cavern, the dim light brushing across her skin and the glint of her red hair like a coal in half-darkness. Her legs hung freely over the lip of the dry basin, and in her hands, a tapestry grew - a living weave of crimson thread that floated weightlessly in the air. The strands obeyed her fingers as if gravity were beneath their concern, winding and looping with quiet precision.
"The gall of that girl..." she murmured.
Her hands moved without pause, weaving the pattern in smooth, deliberate gestures. Each pull of thread shimmered faintly before settling into the fabric of her creation.
"Life for a life, she says - and then kills the offering..."
The threads coiled, then crossed. Her tone was unbothered, but her eyes glowed faintly in the cavern gloom.
"You'll get a child, all right."
A subtle flick of her wrist - a thread passed through a knot, tightening the weave.
"She never wished to survive the process."
Her movements grew wider now, her arms sketching faint circles through the air as the tapestry's edges began to form curves and arches.
"Should've never come here."
A soft hum drifted from her lips, half-song, half-mockery. The pattern in front of her began to resemble something almost organic, a pulse or rhythm woven into cloth.
"I wonder..." she mused aloud, letting a length of thread slip through her fingers. "Should I make the child look like me?"
The fox's hands stilled. The red lines in the air trembled, awaiting her will.
"Do I want that child to be a villain or a saint...?"
The question lingered between the walls of stone, a tone of genuine curiosity beneath the irony. She rolled a loop of thread between her fingertips, eyes narrowing slightly.
"If she is to be a villain, I should give her my features."
Her ear flicked - a faint, involuntary motion.
"Mortal children are cruel. They'd mock her for looking different."
Khara's tongue brushed against one of her fangs, a faint grin tugging at her mouth.
"Build her resentment... let her grow on it. She'll bring an age of chaos into the world."
Her fingers resumed their rhythm, weaving faster now. The air hummed faintly with quiet energy, the tapestry beginning to form coherent symbols, faint sigils written in movement rather than ink.
"Left as an orphan," she murmured, "let her strength awaken at fourteen."
A pause. The next knot resisted her pull.
"No... twelve. Let her act before she learns restraint. Can't have her being a good kid."
She unwound the last knot with surgical precision, then anchored the thread in a new place, binding it with several careful coils.
"I'll have her mind stabilize at sixteen," she decided. "Balance through volatility."
Khara's grin widened slightly - satisfied, thoughtful. "Can't have another meathead like that dark elf."
She began to hum again, soft and playful. Then, suddenly, her ear twitched. Her fingers froze mid-motion.
"The girl is testing boundaries," she noted, tone dry but faintly amused.
Her crimson eyes flickered once - far away, a lamp had gone dark.
A crisp snap of her fingers.
The thread brightened, and her attention returned to the weave. The tapestry pulsed faintly, alive under her touch, as she continued to spin fate into form - a quiet goddess at work, shaping a life that did not yet exist.
