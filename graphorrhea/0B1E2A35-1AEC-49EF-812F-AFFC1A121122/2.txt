The heroine was gone. The legends told by mortal tongues would never speak of what followed - how the figure rose and descended into the basin. In her boundless self-importance, the warrior had not even asked the name of the enigmatic being who would become the parent of her firstborn. She departed, elated by her imagined future, blind to what she had truly invoked.
When the figure stood, it became clear she was a woman. Her garments were flowing and unhurried, draping gracefully around her form, tailored yet soft to her movement. As she walked, the hem whispered across the stone, stirred by her bare, delicate feet. Behind her trailed a great, bushy tail of the same crimson hue as her hair - alive with quiet motion.
This world knew nothing of animal-folk, but if words had existed for her kind, she would have been called a fox-spirit - a Kitsune.
She approached the fallen sacrifice with an unamused expression. The elf girl's body lay cooling upon the stone, limbs slack, head turned to the side. The fox crouched beside her, tilting the head gently to reveal a wound at the temple. When the girl had fallen, bound at the wrists, she had struck the ground unprotected. The height had been enough to kill.
"How careless," the fox murmured - or perhaps only thought it.
With a simple motion of her nail, she cut the ropes binding the girl's hands. Then, lifting the body into her arms with the ease of one accustomed to stillness, she carried her toward the gate leading into the castle.
Inside, the fortress was unexpectedly civilized. Its walls and floors were not raw stone but refined - smoothed, shaped, and built with deliberate grace. Layers of dust dulled the sheen, yet even in abandonment, there was no moss, no vine, no intrusion of wildness.
Beyond the gate lay a long corridor, nearly a hundred meters in length, without torch or sconce to mark the way. It ended in a vast hall, tall as two storeys and a half again. A single narrow window pierced the far wall, flooding the space with blinding white light. Beneath that radiance sat a stone throne, heavy with dust.
Doors lined both sides of the hall, each in some stage of decay. Their frames sagged, and the wood had rotted into pulp; they would not survive another attempt to open. Above them ran two balconies, suggesting rooms and chambers beyond, but the fox did not pause to look.
She walked to the only open doorway on the first floor - where no door remained, only empty hinges. Within lay a small, unadorned room, containing nothing but a bed in the far corner, its gray sheets long faded. The fox laid the girl's body upon it; the bed creaked in response, as though protesting its first burden in ages.
After a brief glance, she turned to the wall and extended her hand toward one corner. The mortar began to crumble in dusty rivulets beneath her touch. From between the stones, something grew - a root, or perhaps a branch, thin at first, then thickening as it reached for her hand. She grasped it and drew it forth. It lengthened with her pull until, at last, the portion remaining in the wall dried, cracked, and fell away as though deliberately severed.
Holding the branch before her, the fox began to work. Her hands moved in slow, fluid gestures, weaving invisible lines through the air. With each motion, bark fell away, the wood reshaping itself, thinning and folding into ordered pieces. The sticks merged seamlessly, grown together as if guided by unseen life, until they formed a chair - simple, elegant, alive in its craftsmanship.
She sat upon it beside the bed, her expression tranquil, unperturbed - as though this act of creation were as ordinary as breathing. Then, extending her hands, she rested her palms upon the wound at the girl's temple. The hair parted beneath her fingers as if erased. The skin lifted and opened like a veil.
Beneath it, the pale bone was fractured. With nails as fine as surgical tools, the fox plucked the fragments one by one, exposing the delicate structure beneath - the soft, quivering organ that waited in stillness.
Tugging at the unseen, the Fox began to weave thin threads of living red into being. Unmoved by gravity or breeze, they hung in the air as though the world itself did not dare to disturb them.
More threads arose from the girl's head - longer, finer - stretching upward like a fabric of life unfurling from within. When enough had manifested, the Fox took a handful in each arm and pulled sharply, widening her stance. The sudden motion sent ripples through the threads; they flowed and tangled, knotting into patterns that formed themselves beyond deliberate touch.
No longer guided by conscious hand, the strands moved of their own accord - currents of red in silent motion, weaving themselves into a shape.
That shape defied full description. It was geometric yet organic, vast yet self-contained: a voluminous tapestry of red upon red. Rhombuses, triangles, and circles interlocked through arcs and sweeping lines, pulsing faintly with life. It stretched to the height of a grown person, suspended in still air.
At its base, thick cords of the same red descended into the girl's skull, vanishing into her being. One of these cords was frayed - right where the wound lay.
The Fox examined the tapestry with a fleeting glance, then fixed her gaze upon the single imperfection. She made a small, delicate motion in the air, as though plucking something intangible, and the frayed end rose toward her hand.
Her expression shifted - curiosity giving way to disbelief.
"To sever a soul from a mere fall..." she murmured, her voice barely a breath. "A chance in an eon."
A death of such kind was not ordinary; it was a stroke of misfortune so rare that even a goddess might pause.
She drew back, tracing her eyes along the intricate lattice of threads, studying the unseen pathways between form and life. Then, rotating her right hand in a slow circle, she summoned another filament into being - a single line of red, appearing from nothing and coiling gently around her arm. Grasping one end, she sighed, adjusted her posture, and began to weave.
Thread by thread, she worked the new strand into the broken connection. Her movements were slow, deliberate, filled with silent grace.
The day had already grown old when she began, the sunlight fading into the jungle beyond. Yet she did not cease when night fell, nor when dawn returned. She continued her careful labor, weaving and mending, testing the strength of every thread.
Each time she pulled, the very stone beneath her feet cracked from the invisible strain. She clicked her tongue softly at each imperfection, repairing what the world itself could not endure.
By the second day, she had moved through nearly the entire tapestry - thickening lines, softening angles, redrawing the living geometry until it felt right. She did not tire, nor notice the passage of time.
For beings like her, creation and restoration were one and the same act - an unending conversation with the fabric of existence.
Tugging once more at the new red connection where the girl's soul met the exposed brain, the Fox tested its strength. The cord held fast, unyielding. A small smile flickered on her face.
Drawing back, she made a sweeping gesture, and the tapestry began to move. It swirled upon itself, folding and condensing - first into a cocoon, then a narrow cylinder, and at last a single line that vanished into the girl's skull like light being drawn into a lens.
Without touching, the Fox willed the fragments of bone to return to their rightful places. They obeyed her will, the cracks knitting shut under a mist of faint red glow. Then the skin closed, soft and seamless, like a flower folding its petals at dusk. From the smooth surface, new strands of hair sprouted, glossy and alive, leaving no trace of the fatal wound.
Satisfied, the Fox gently turned the girl onto her back and rose from her chair. Without a word, she left the room, her tail gliding after her like a slow-burning flame.
