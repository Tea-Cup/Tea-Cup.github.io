The darkness had conquered the chamber entirely by the time Cadere finished eating the fruit with the texture of a tomato. Her thoughts, circling her strange condition, reached no satisfying conclusion, so she decided it was best to return to bed. It was not an easy task; the moonlight had weakened, no longer spilling through the window, and she had to feel her way through the murk. Guided only by touch and faint glimmers that came once her eyes adjusted, she changed out of her servant's uniform and into the sleepwear from earlier.
There was little to bump into - the room's barrenness helped - but she still had to fetch a chair from the corridor to set her clothes upon. There was no wardrobe, no place for order or modesty. As she busied herself with these idle motions, her mind returned to practical worries.
What am I here for? What will Daemii-sama use me for? Will I be fed like this every day?
The fruits were juicy enough to keep thirst at bay, but there was no water. Would that continue? What about washing? What about light? What about... leaving?
She never noticed the moment her thoughts slipped apart. Sleep claimed her mid-question, her body surrendering where her mind still lingered.
When morning - or what she assumed was morning - came, she woke feeling fresh. The bed was unfamiliar, the walls foreign, and the absence of dreams made it feel as if she had been displaced in space and time, leaping directly from darkness into tomorrow. Then memory crept back.
Am I now one day old? she thought. How ridiculous.
She swung her legs down to the dusty floor and froze. The clothes she had left on the chair were now folded neatly and clean. Two new fruits rested atop them - one a soft purple, the other golden-yellow. She did not know their names; she had never seen such colors in food before. The purple one felt crisp, like an apple. The yellow one was like the tomato-like fruit she'd eaten last night.
Would it be rude to ask her master about them? She decided against it. Better to avoid Daemii-sama unless absolutely necessary.
Still, despite the gifts, she could not shake the sense of captivity. The fruits were delicious, yet they felt like the rations of a well-treated prisoner.
Cadere dressed and stepped into the corridor, biting into one fruit and carrying the other. The sunlight pouring in was generous today - enough to wander by. Perhaps she could explore, as Daemii-sama had suggested. That dark passage beside the kitchen... she had been told to look there during the day.
She returned to the room she called the kitchen. The path beyond it was clearer now, faint light tracing the shape of stairs descending into the cold below. The air smelled stale but not rotten. To one side was another wide chamber, long enough that the far end disappeared into shadow. A dead end for now, she decided - she would need a light.
There were other doors yet untested, and her curiosity was waking. She returned to the hall, the grit beneath her bare feet no longer unpleasant, almost familiar. One by one, she pushed open every door she passed, watching them crumble and fall. Dust billowed, and she moved on before it settled, relentless in her quiet exploration.
Four doors down, she looped back to the first - none held much of interest. But behind one, she found a broad stairway. Carefully, she climbed. It led to a balcony overlooking the hall - an upper floor lined with more doors.
Those, too, she opened, finding only emptiness: rooms of varying shapes and corridors curling into dark. The doors were so brittle they fell at a touch; their purpose had long since died. Still, she mapped the structure in her mind, piece by piece, until she felt she could almost sense its bones beneath the dust.
Should she be disturbing a place this ancient? Perhaps. But Daemii-sama had not stopped her, and silence was permission enough.
She crossed to the far side of the hall. These rooms were stranger. One had pillars hugging the walls like silent sentinels. Another contained a staircase, and another was choked with fragments of wood. She ascended again, drawn onward by a faint gleam.
A narrow stair spiraled upward, growing brighter with every step until she emerged into a small tower chamber. One entire wall was a window - open, glassless, wide enough for two of her to stand shoulder to shoulder.
And beyond it - 
The world.
Not the cold gray of stone and dust, but a boundless horizon of green beneath a sky of endless blue. She stood motionless, the sight striking her like a forgotten memory.
It looked like an ocean turned upside down. The sound of leaves, the scent of life - it all rushed in at once, overwhelming her. She leaned into the light without realizing, drawn to the vividness like a moth to flame.
But as soon as her head crossed the threshold, nausea flooded her. The world tilted. The window vanished behind her.
For an instant, she felt gravity take her - felt the rush of air, the tower receding, the sky darkening. Then nothing.
She blacked out before she ever reached the ground.
