Pain was the first thing she knew. A hot, sharp ache in her ankle.
"Gaaah!"
Cadere cried out, instinctively trying to pull her leg away. But something held it firm - unyielding, immovable. In a panic, she clawed backward, scraping her hands on rough stone. When she dared to look down, she froze.
Khara was sitting at her feet, one hand wrapped around Cadere's ankle.
The fox's expression was calm, almost bored, yet her grip was absolute. Fear flooded Cadere's chest. Her heart raced in dread - was this it? Had her purpose finally revealed itself as torment? Punishment?
Her eyes darted around. The familiar basin stood beside her, the same one where she had first died. Beyond it lay the yawning entrance of the castle. The dim light filtering in made the whole cave feel smaller, closer, as if she had awoken inside a memory.
She tried twice more to wrench her foot free, but Khara's hold didn't yield an inch. At last, Cadere gave up and went still, breathing hard.
"Calm down," Khara said, rolling her eyes. "You broke your ankle. I just put it back."
Cadere blinked. Slowly, she pulled the leg closer, careful not to move it much. The pain still pulsed through it, but it felt... right again, in a strange way.
"You left the castle," Khara continued. "You touched the world."
"Am I not allowed to leave?" Cadere asked, touching her dirt-streaked shin. Thin scratches ran along her skin.
Khara's gaze was patient, but distant. "You are not allowed to enter. You are dead in that world, and the world simply reminded you of that."
"To enter...?" Cadere frowned. "Am I not inside right now?"
"You are within my world," Khara corrected gently, adjusting her seated posture. "My domain. Here, it is my law that decides who lives and dies." She drew her tail around, long and red as flame, combing her fingers through its deep fur.
Cadere hesitated. "But... why am I alive here? Why did you reanimate me?"
Khara paused mid-stroke, a flicker of something unreadable passing across her face. "...A whim," she admitted. "You were given to me. I saw no reason to keep a corpse."
"I see..." Cadere murmured, lowering her head. "Then I'm just a... currency."
The thought hollowed her. She wrapped her arms around her knees, shrinking in on herself.
Khara's eyes softened, if only slightly. "I could rescind that decision," she said evenly. "But you should understand - this world has no afterlife. When you die here, there is nothing. Not even the idea of anything. You vanish. Your essence returns to the pool of Soul."
"No heaven. No reincarnation..." Cadere whispered. "That church really was lying then." Some faint, fogged memory stirred - temples, promises of salvation for the faithful, and the elven belief in cycles of rebirth. It all felt so far away now.
Khara nodded absently. "There are exceptions - rare ones. Sometimes, a soul lingers, fusing with the land or the memory of a place. But that will not happen here." She sighed, looking the girl over with mild curiosity. "By all rights, I should have dispersed you already. But... I don't want to."
Cadere lifted her eyes slowly. "Then... what do you want me to do?"
Khara tilted her head, thinking for a moment.
"For one," she said at last, "I want you to be more respectful with your tone."
Cadere flinched slightly, drawing her knees tighter, eyes cast down.
"And second..." Khara's voice softened into something amused. "Why don't you clean the place up?"
Cadere blinked, confused. Clean? This place? The endless castle of dust and ruin? The world itself, gray and hollow? The scope of it seemed absurd.
"I bring you food, and anything else you might wish for," Khara added with a small, playful smirk. "As a reward."
That did sound tempting. Perhaps the somber stillness of this domain would feel lighter with something to do.
"But I have no mop," Cadere muttered, half to herself. "No water, no broom. The dust is so thick I might need a shovel instead."
Khara raised a single finger. "That will not be a problem. Complete the first point, and you will receive your first tool."
Cadere blinked in confusion. "The first point?" Then it dawned on her.
She stood - slowly, still favoring her leg - then bowed deeply, lowering her head to the cold stone.
"It will be done, Daemii-sama."
A smile curled across the fox's face. Pride - subtle, regal - glimmered there as she watched the girl remain in her bow.
