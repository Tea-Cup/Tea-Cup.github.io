"So... what now? Do I just sweep it all?"
Cadere placed her newly made broom upon the floor and began sweeping the dust toward the hall. The bristles made a dry, whispering sound as they dragged across the stone, raising more haze than progress. The air filled with drifting motes, glittering faintly in her lamplight before settling again.
She paused, squinting. "No, wait... you mop dust. You sweep dirt."
Another stroke of the broom sent a thick puff into her face. She sneezed violently, the sound echoing through the corridor. Her brief sense of purpose deflated, leaving only the stale air and a faint tickle in her nose. Leaning her forehead against the broom handle, she sighed. "This doesn't really help, does it..."
Brooms were for debris, she reasoned. For heavier, obedient things. Dust was too free, too light to be ruled by bristles. Perhaps she needed something else - water, a rag, maybe a proper mop. Or perhaps, she thought as her gaze drifted down the dark corridor, she should look for more things first.
Leaving the broom where it stood, she took up her lantern and wandered deeper into the castle.
The right stairwell led to the second floor, where the air was stiller, thicker. She passed by a room filled with rotted wood and splintered beams - this would have been the place for a broom, she mused, though she kept walking. The lantern in her hand gave her reason enough to explore, its steady light promising discovery.
Corridor followed corridor, an endless succession of stone ribs and shadowed arches. The vastness of her "workspace," as she called it, began to weigh on her. Even if she had a mop and a bucket, she realized, it would take her an eternity just to walk it all. The thought made her shoulders sag. Her expression darkened, dull and distant, like someone already halfway to giving up.
A faint breeze touched her ear. She blinked. Air movement meant openings - more of them. More doors to crumble, more rooms that led to nowhere. The old castle was full of such, and each one turned to fine dust in her hands.
Another use for a broom, she thought dryly.
At the far end of the corridor, one door gleamed faintly. Sunlight trickled through the cracks. She approached, her steps echoing hollowly. The door, brittle with age, broke apart before she even touched it. But instead of collapsing inward, it fell outward.
Cadere froze.
Beyond the doorway, the room was gone. No walls, no ceiling, no floor - only emptiness, open sky, and a vertiginous drop. The structure had sheared away completely from the castle's body, leaving a raw, fractured edge of stone.
"A hanging tower?" she whispered, squatting near the broken threshold. "Why now? Why are they all failing now..."
Then the realization dawned with quiet dread: this too must be outside the Domain.
She did not dare draw closer. Instead, she crouched, elbows on her knees, her face resting on her hands. The air beyond was painfully alive - the alien green of grass, the forgotten blue of sky, the mocking gold of sun. Colors of another world.
Her expression, once hopeful, hollowed into stillness. She knew now that those colors promised nothing to her but death. That world would not accept her touch, it would strip her away for daring to belong.
Yet what she felt wasn't despair - not quite. It was something softer, lonelier. Like offering help to someone who refuses it.
A memory rose to meet her thoughts: an old man struggling with a cart, one wheel sunk in the path. She remembered reaching to help him, remembered his hand batting hers aside. I can do fine on my own, he'd said. She had obeyed, but it stung.
Why recall that of all things? Was it important enough to survive death - or so trivial that even death had ignored it? She couldn't tell. But it lingered, heavy and wordless.
The world before her said nothing. It didn't need her. It would hurt her if she tried to belong again.
Standing, Cadere picked up a splinter of the ruined door and flicked it out into the open air. She watched it fall, turning end over end until it vanished below. Then she lifted her lamp, gazing at the warm filament within - still glowing, still alive.
A small, reckless thought bloomed. She extended her arm and pushed the lamp past the threshold.
Instantly, the light died.
Her breath caught. Panic flooded her chest. She pulled it back in - dark glass, lifeless metal. "Oh no... what have I done?" she whispered, clutching the lantern as though apology might fix it. She looked around wildly, but of course, there was nothing, only the long corridor and its patient dark.
Then, suddenly, that darkness flashed white.
It was gone as soon as it came, replaced by a familiar orange glow. Cadere blinked, staring at the lamp. A thin line ran from top to bottom, pulsing softly, whole again.
She exhaled a shaky laugh, one hand pressed over her racing heart. "Don't do that to me," she murmured to it, voice trembling with relief.
