Cadere felt filthy all over after that, but by the time she dragged the chair and bucket back to the main hall, she no longer had the energy to care. What was one more discomfort in a life that had already been taken from her? She walked without focus, her limbs moving out of habit, her mind hollow. The thought came and went: it would be nice, at least, to feel clean again.
But there was no river here, no sponges, no rags. The bucket she had was dry too. Maybe a well existed somewhere - Daemii-same had said water was below - but she hadn't looked for it. She imagined, half-serious, half-mocking herself, clawing through the ground with her bare hands and bone. It would take eternity, but what was eternity if time no longer meant anything? Maybe it would pass as quickly as a bird pecking through a diamond mountain.
With that dull, self-deprecating thought, she took the lamp and went toward the kitchen hall on the first floor. There, she found a stairway she had ignored before. It descended into shadow, and she figured that was as good a direction as any.
The cellar was what she expected - empty, stale, indifferent. Perhaps it was even less dusty than the rest, or maybe she was only imagining that because she wanted something to feel less hopeless. She walked the perimeter, tracing the walls with her fingers, until she found a break in the brickwork. The gap looked both deliberate and accidental, like someone had once tried to seal it and given up.
Beyond it was another stairway, stone this time, carved roughly from the rock itself. She followed it down. The passage became more like a cave, the air damp and cool, the sound of her own breathing loud against the stone. Then the tunnel opened into a small cavern.
In the middle stood a metal shape - a cylinder with a long lever and a spigot. A pump. Or what used to be one.
She touched the lever and it moved, faintly scraping inside. She pushed and pulled at it, hearing dull thuds from below, not metallic, but dense, like earth packed tight. Maybe the pipe was blocked. Setting the lamp nearby, she began working the lever rhythmically, tired arms finding a strange persistence. Something shifted after a few pulls - the sound changed.
She braced herself and pulled harder. The lever rose all the way up, and then - she froze. Beneath her came a sudden rush, a deep, distant rumble that made her heart stutter. She tried again, pushing the lever down, and this time felt real resistance, like something alive was pushing back. Then - splash. Wet dirt spat from the spigot.
She smiled faintly. It was something.
More pulls, more mud. Then, suddenly, water - brown and sputtering, but water nonetheless - burst out with force, splashing her arms, the wall, the floor. The sound filled the cavern. She laughed quietly, breath catching from exertion. The water cleared bit by bit, until each pump drew a clean, cold stream.
She crouched, cupping some of it in her hands, but hesitated. It was mixed with dirt from the floor. She needed the bucket. She ran back for it - more a shuffle than a sprint - and returned to the pump.
Setting the bucket under the spigot, she pressed the lever gently, letting a slow, steady stream fill it. The water glimmered faintly in the lamplight. She saw her reflection tremble in its surface - eyes red-rimmed, lips faintly curled into something that could have been a smile.
She lifted her hands and drank. The first swallow sent a cold ache through her chest. It was so sharp she nearly gasped. Her teeth hurt from it, but it felt... real. So real that her eyes burned. She hadn't realized how thirsty she was - not just for water, but for something to feel again.
Without thinking, she grabbed the bucket and upended it over her head.
The shock was immediate. Her breath vanished, her skin burned with cold, her mind emptied. Then came laughter - small, breathless, disbelieving laughter - as she gasped for air. The chill raced down her spine, and for the first time since waking in this place, she felt alive. Every drop sliding down her back reminded her that she still had a body, that her heart was still beating.
She pumped another bucketful, trembling from the cold, and hurried back upstairs. Whether she was returning to the castle or never truly left didn't matter. She collapsed into the bed, pulling the sheets over herself. The fabric clung to her wet skin until her own warmth began to seep back in.
It was almost unbearable - the contrast, the heat rising after the freeze. Her breath came in short bursts, her chest was tight, tears spilled hot down her cheeks before she could stop them. She curled up and pressed her face into the pillow, laughing weakly between the tears.
What a fool. What a ridiculous thing to cry over.
But she couldn't stop smiling. Her body shivered, her nose ran, her throat ached, and still she laughed at herself - for crying, for living, for being too stubborn to give up.
"Damn it all," she whispered, her voice shaking. "I'm still here."
The laughter broke into sobs again.
"Screw the world... screw you all..."
Her eyes blurred. The room was spinning softly in the lamplight.
"You're not getting rid of me that easy."
She pressed the blanket closer, body still trembling, still alive. The shivers became gentler, the warmth steadier. For the first time since her death, she felt something like defiance. A fragile, flickering thing - but hers.
