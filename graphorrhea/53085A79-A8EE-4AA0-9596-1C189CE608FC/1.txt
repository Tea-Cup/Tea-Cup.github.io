A man, in his late twenties is driving he works as a delivery driver and earns enough to pay all dues and get some cash to spend on vain whims, as he is driving the sun is bright, it's a clear sunny day almost no clouds in the sky to serve as shade, in the distance he spots a woman, presumably wrapping trash, she's kneeling, as he passes over her, her body is extremely alluring, with delightful curves, built for lovemaking, he is entranced and loses control of his car, rans over the walkway and beats his head against the horn, as he regains control, he spots the woman, all wiggling hopping his way, he is about to have a heart attack.
-Sir, are you alright? 
-Miss, y-you have to understand, w-wearing these tight pants in that gorgeous body and kneeling, you're prone to cause accidents all over the city.
~she smiles~ 
-Oh you like what you see? ~she pulls her phone~ give me your phone number and let's see how lucky you are.
~his eyes widen, he can scarcely believe his "Luck", unable to understand what's happening~
-Oo-oh y-yes, it's xxxxxxx, please get in touch
-I will, what's your name? 
-Jean and yours?
-Jean huh? Jean-Luc? hehe, I'm Belladonna, yes, the flower, yes, its very toxic, look my mother was a Hippie and she never knew who my father was, soo...
-Oh, nice name Bella, belladonna is also used in medicine to soothe pains, just like you're doing right now
~she smiles and looks him in the eye~
-A charmer, thanks for the compliment, I will allow you to call me Bella, well, we've stolen each others time for too long, see you Jean, drive carefully and stop staring woman in compromising positions
-Oh I'm sorry, my weaknesses to the beauties of this wonderful world sometimes overpower every sense I have, please forgive me, I didn't mean any disrespect.
~both say their farewells and go on their way, the thought of what just happened lays heavily on the driver's mind, he won't be able to shake off the event anytime soon and hopes she contacts him~
