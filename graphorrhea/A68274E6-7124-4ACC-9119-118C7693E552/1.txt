The first molten rays of dawn sluiced through the high, narrow windows of the stone barracks, painting stripes of gold across the worn floorboards and the faces of stirring men. No sergeants bellowed reveille, no boots stomped in urgent formation. Yet, old habits, carved deep by years of permanent deployment, refused to die. Men shifted on their straw-stuffed mattresses, the rustle of coarse blankets and the creak of wooden frames a familiar symphony. This leniency might seem dissonant in a military camp, but then, we weren’t a regular platoon. We were coddled with rest, glutted with hearty food, entrusted with gleaming, forged weapons, and granted freedoms unheard of elsewhere. Yet, this wasn’t the soft indulgence of noble scions or a haven for misfits. No. We were that precious to the Kingdom—the last flickering candle in a world consumed by darkness. We were the scalpel thrown into wounds so deep and violent that survival wasn’t merely uncertain, it was often deemed impossible. And I, like the others, basked in this perceived privilege, a dangerous warmth. For it was no reward, no indulgence, but the crushing duty borne by the strongest remnants of our species. A duty paid in blood and sanity.
The morning routine unfolded with practiced ease. Outside, the air thickened with the savoury perfume of roasting meats and bubbling porridge from the field kitchens. Inside the barracks, men moved with the quiet efficiency of predators at dawn. Splashing faces with icy water from stone basins, scraping stubble with well-honed blades, the rasp of whetstones on spearheads and sword edges. Light calisthenics followed—stretches that pulled sinews taut, lunges that coiled power in thighs, push-ups that hardened shoulders already burdened by impending doom. As others fell into formation for drills, I took my turn patrolling the inner perimeter, a path worn smooth by countless boots.
My path led towards the southern edge of the camp, where the ground fell away sharply. And there, perched on a wind-scoured lip of rock overlooking the vast, terrible expanse, was her. Commander Khara. Below us, the Southern Deserts stretched like a diseased hide—ochre, crimson, and bruised purple under the climbing sun. It wasn’t just sand. It was the land of monsters. The birthplace of the plague that had gnawed at the world’s bones for centuries, reducing continents to ash and nations to memory. For anyone who had stood at the bleeding edge of the border, that vista was a physical blow. It was the graveyard of legions, the place where souls weren’t just broken, but shattered by the thousand. Not for victory—a concept as mythical as dragons now—but for the desperate, gasping delay of total annihilation. Even the grizzled veterans of our unit, men who’d carved their names in demon ichor, couldn’t suppress a grimace, a tightening of the jaw, when they looked south. Yet, Khara sat as still as the rock beneath her, gazing into that abyss.
She was the current vessel of the Khara lineage, a family whispered to be spun from starlight and divine wrath. Legends claimed their progenitor was a Goddess known only to them, a solitary shield against the ancient dark. Others said each Khara was that Goddess, reborn endlessly to hold the line. Whatever the truth, no sane soul denied Khara’s power or her beauty, both existing on a scale that defied the merely human. This generation’s Khara possessed a form that was lean, undeniably feminine, yet radiated a contained ferocity. Her long hair, the colour of freshly spilled arterial blood, lashed like living flame against the steel held in her arm. Her weapon. Not a sword, not a spear, but a war scythe.
It was a monstrous thing. The blade alone was longer than a man’s leg, forged from a single cast steel, its crescent edge gleaming with a cold, hungry light. The haft, thick as a young oak, was reinforced with leather bands meshing with shy decorations, terminating in a brutal spike. It was a weapon designed for annihilation, capable of shearing through stone fortifications, pulverising siege engines. Castle-breaker steel. Yet, she held it against her shoulder casually, as a shepherd might hold a crook, her fingers resting lightly on the cold metal, her crimson hair whispering secrets against its lethal curve. The sheer, effortless dissonance of her delicate form and that engine of destruction was breathtaking, terrifying.
Lost in thought, I’d been gazing at her silhouette against the hellish dawn. She hadn’t moved, her gaze fixed unblinking on the monstrous horizon. My story? It felt insignificant here. I was strong, yes. One of the elite, a guardian of humanity’s flickering ember. Yet beside her, I was background noise. A spear-carrier in the epic. Our ranks teemed with such men: some burning with desperate valor, clinging to duty as a lifeline, others hollowed out, seeking only the roar of battle to drown the screams inside, and a few, like me, drawn not by bloodlust or obligation, but by awe. By the magnetic pull of the myth embodied in Khara. To stand near her, to witness that power, was a reason to breathe.
My own journey began in the regular army, a green volunteer trembling in ill-fitting leathers. This Khara’s strength is… elemental. Raw, physical power. Just look at the scythe! A greatsword lashed to a siege spear. Merely contemplating its weight made my shoulders ache. Yet I’d seen her wield it. Not with brute force, but with a dancer’s lethal grace. Effortless leaps that defied gravity, the scythe becoming a blur of whistling darkness. The crunch of shattered chitin, the wet tear of limbs severed like rotten branches, plate armour crumpling like parchment under its kiss. It was for those sights—the whirlwind of crimson hair and dark steel carving through impossible odds—that I had driven myself beyond human limits. Ferocity became my trademark, valor my shield, until the summons came: a place beside the legend.
My reverie was shattered by the arrival of the day’s grim cargo: a new batch of recruits. Eight men shuffled into a ragged line near the command tent, escorted by stony-faced regular army guards. To be sent to Khara’s regiment was an ambiguous sentence. Cast-offs from other units, deemed either too valuable to waste elsewhere, or too troublesome to keep. Heroes or headcases… the line was often blurred. Khara held the final, irrevocable veto. Her judgment was swift, inscrutable, and absolute. She approached them now, not in ceremonial garb, but in her battle armour. It was a terrifying sight. The once-polished plates were gouged, dented, and stained with layers of ancient, baked-on gore—rust brown, black, and unsettling streaks of unnatural purples and greens. It wasn’t armour, it was a testament to countless horrors endured. She moved with a predator’s fluid economy, her gaze sweeping over them like a physical weight.
The recruits reacted like startled prey. One man stood rigidly at attention, sweat beading on his pale forehead despite the morning chill, eyes fixed straight ahead, unseeing. Khara stopped before him, her head tilting slightly. She leaned in, close enough that her crimson hair brushed his stained tunic, and took a loud, deliberate sniff. A low, guttural growl vibrated in her throat, a sound of pure disdain. The stench of cowardice, perhaps, invisible to us but pungent to her senses. The man flinched as if struck.
Next was defiance incarnate. A burly man with scarred knuckles met her gaze head-on, a challenge burning in his eyes. Khara didn’t blink. She stepped closer, invading his space, her own eyes—the colour of desert iron under a noon sun—locking onto his. An age seemed to pass in that silent scrutiny. “Well,” she murmured, her voice a low rasp like stone grinding on stone, yet carrying unnervingly clear, “aren’t you a wild beast?” The man’s jaw tightened, his chin lifting fractionally. “Plenty of blood on your hands,” she observed, tilting her head the other way, studying him like a curious hawk. “Not squeamish about getting them dirty, I see.” Her gaze flickered to the battered, poorly maintained sword slung across his back. “Swinging that stick around… I’ll give you plenty of swinging, alright…” A ripple of nervousness crossed the defiant man’s face, his eyes darted sideways, caught out. “Now, now,” Khara purred, a dangerous edge beneath the softness, “don’t be getting cold feet now of all times. You weren’t this anxious back then, were you? When the blood was warm?” The man swallowed audibly, his knuckles white where they gripped his belt, but he held his ground, his breathing becoming a harsh rasp in the tense silence. A ghost of something—approval? amusement?—flickered in Khara’s eyes. She moved on.
The next recruit practically vibrated with eager energy. His eyes shone with an almost fanatical light, fixed on Khara like a pilgrim beholding a saint. I know, bud, I thought, remembering my own starstruck terror. I know. Khara gave him only a cursory glance, a faint, unreadable quirk touching her lips before she passed.
The remaining five were a gallery of desperation and numbness. One had eyes like smoked glass, vacant and dead, staring through the world. What did Khara see in those hollow sockets? What flicker of potential, or lack thereof, did her preternatural senses detect? Her inspection was swift, methodical. A pause here, a dismissive flick of her gaze there. Finally, she stepped back.
"Five of you,” her voice, though she likely considered it quiet, rolled over the recruits like distant thunder, “march back inland. Alive. Today. Consider it a Heaven’s gift.” She let the implication hang—their original units likely considered them dead already. Her gaze swept over the three who remained, including the eager one and the defiant beast. “The remaining three who stay? Consider me your gift of Heaven.” A bleak, terrifying promise.
Her voice hardened, cutting through the morning air. “I have no intention of throwing your lives away like chaff. But understand this: you will die.” She stated it as immutable fact, like the desert’s heat. “I can carve a path, I can break their charge, but I cannot be your shadow. The reapers will find you. They will come for your warmth, your fear, your very breath.” She paused, letting the image sink in—the skittering horrors, the towering behemoths, the things that sucked light and hope from the world. “And they will bleed,” she snarled, a sudden, fierce conviction flaring in her eyes, “if you strike them true! For some, the duty of being humanity’s final shield is cause enough to die well. For the rest of you,” her gaze swept over them, lingering on the dead-eyed man for a fraction, “who care nothing for grand causes? Then fight for the next breath. Fight for the heartbeat after that. Know there is no retreat. No glorious return. Only forward. Only into that,” she jabbed her thumb over her shoulder towards the malevolent desert, “into the starved, alien eyes of your prey… who sees you as its next meal!” Her voice rose, not in volume, but in intensity, a forge-heat of purpose. “This war didn’t start with your birth. It won’t end with your death. You, men, you arrived just in time to be the filling in the pie!"
A grim, almost feral smile touched her lips. “So here is what I demand: I want your dreams haunted by slaughter! I want your hearts forged in the furnace of valor! I want your names—if they survive the butcher’s bill—spoken with pride beside mine! And in exchange?” She paused, the promise hanging heavy. “I offer you not just survival… but life. For however long the dawn finds you breathing. Lieutenant Aris,” she gestured towards me without turning, “will answer your questions and tell you where you’ll bleed."
With a final, searing look that seemed to brand their souls, she turned. Her armoured boots struck the stony earth with a heavy, resonant clang-clang-clang, each step echoing finality. The monstrous war scythe, effortlessly shouldered now, caught the sun, a single, blinding flare of lethal light before she strode away, leaving the chosen three standing in the shadow of the myth, the stink of the desert, and the deafening silence of their impending doom. The true weight of the gift, and the curse, of standing beside Khara settled upon them, cold and heavy as her blood-caked armour.
