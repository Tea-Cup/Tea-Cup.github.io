The southern wind, tainted with the scent of something vaguely organic and rotten, picked up as the bloated, crimson sun bled into the dunes. Campfires, defiant sparks against the encroaching indigo twilight, blossomed across the stony plateau like fallen stars. The air hung thick with the day’s exhaustion—the metallic tang of sweat, the sharp bite of crushed desert herbs under boot, and the pervasive, gritty dust that coated everything. But over it all, now, rose the rich, savoury aroma of stew bubbling in iron pots suspended over the flames, the sizzle of fat dripping from spitted game, and the warm, comforting scent of coarse bread toasted on stones.
The newcomers sat like islands in a sea of seasoned warriors. Their first day under Khara’s shadow had been baptism by fire and stone. Sparring drills that felt less like practice and more like attempts on their lives, endurance runs across treacherous scree slopes under the desert sun, and the constant, unnerving pressure of veterans watching with eyes that missed nothing. Discipline wasn’t shouted, it was enforced with the silent, terrifying efficiency of a unit that knew hesitation meant death. Strength wasn’t just physical, it was the strength to push past the point of breaking when the veteran beside you barely seemed winded.
Now, in the firelight’s flickering embrace, the veterans descended. Not with malice, precisely, but with the predatory curiosity of wolves inspecting new pack members. The camp’s social fabric, woven from shared horror and dark humour, began to absorb the fresh threads.
Rolan was practically vibrating, perched on a log near a central fire. Before his bowl was half-empty, he was surrounded. Not by bullies, but by a cluster of younger veterans whose eyes held the same fervent sparkle his did. One, a wiry archer named Kael with fingers permanently stained with fletching glue, leaned in conspiratorially. “Saw you gaping at the Commander during inspection, pup. First time, eh?” Rolan flushed, nodding vigorously. “Like staring into the sun, isn’t it? Beautiful and terrifying.” Another, a hulking spearman called Borin whose laugh was surprisingly high-pitched, nudged him. “Wait ’til you see her move. It ain’t human. It’s poetry written in shattered bone.” They swapped stories—embellished tales of Khara cleaving through a charging Razorback Behemoth single-handedly, rumours about the scythe’s origins, how it’s forged in a dying star, quenched in the blood of a fallen god-king, and hushed, almost reverent discussions of her impossible speed and strength. Their affection wasn’t romantic, it was the devotion of acolytes to a living saint of war, a desperate anchor of awe in a world drowning in despair. Rolan drank it in, his own admiration mirrored and amplified in their fervent whispers.
Silas sat apart, huddled near a smaller fire, methodically chewing tasteless stew, his gaze fixed on the flames as if seeking oblivion within them. He didn’t react when a shadow fell over him. Laora, a veteran scout known for her sharp tongue and sharper knives, plopped down uninvited. She was whip-thin, her face a map of sun-wrinkles and faded scars, her dark hair braided tight. “Cheery sort, aren’t you?” she remarked, her voice dry as the desert wind. Silas didn’t flinch, didn’t look up. Laora nudged his boot with hers. “Look, sunshine. We’ve all got ghosts. Mine haunt me louder after a few ales.” She pulled a flask from her hip, took a swig, and offered it. He ignored it. Undeterred, Laora leaned closer, her voice dropping to a raspy whisper. “See that?” She pointed towards Khara’s fire, larger but no more ornate than the others. “Even she sits with the stink and the noise. Know why? ’Cause tomorrow, some of this laughter gets snuffed out. Maybe hers. Maybe mine. Probably yours, with that attitude.” She nudged him again, harder. “So, enjoy the stew. It’s usually worse. Listen to Borin’s terrible jokes. Watch Kael try to flirt with the cook’s daughter and get chased off with a ladle. Feel the fire on your face. It’s warm. For now. That’s more than the things out there will give you.” There was no pity in her eyes, only a brutal, pragmatic kind of empathy. Silas finally glanced at her, a flicker of something - exhaustion, maybe recognition—in his dead eyes before returning to the flames. Laora stayed, sipping her ale, a silent, prickly sentinel against his solitude.
Garrick had chosen a fire where the veterans looked like they chewed rocks for breakfast. Scarred faces, knuckles like gnarled oak, eyes that held the flat, dangerous gleam of seasoned killers who thrived in the chaos. One, a mountain of a man named Varek with a shaved head and a knotted scar running from temple to jaw, locked eyes with Garrick the moment he sat. The air crackled, not just from the fire. Varek took a long pull from a clay mug, wiped his mouth with the back of a hand missing two fingers. “Think you’re tough, newcomer?” His voice was a gravelly rumble. Garrick met his gaze, the defiance still simmering, tempered now by a day of brutal reality. “Tough enough,” he grunted. A ripple of low chuckles went around the fire. Fenn, another veteran, lean and fox-faced with eyes that never stopped moving, smirked. “Defiance is cheap out here. Lasts about as long as a snowflake in the Deep Sands. What matters is useful.” He tapped his temple. Varek stood, an imposing shadow against the firelight. “Let’s see if your swing matches your stare. Make the circle, men! Bring us blunted blades!” It wasn’t a request. It was a test, a setting of the pecking order. Garrick rose slowly, as the group around the fire shifted, forming an impromptu ring of leering, expectant faces. Respect here wasn’t given—it was taken, often painfully. And everyone, even Varek, understood the unspoken rule: you could challenge each other, you could bleed each other, but you never challenged the Commander. That line was etched in blood deeper than any scar.
Commander Khara sat not on a throne, but on a worn, saddle-shaped stone near one of the larger fires. Her monstrous scythe leaned against the rock within easy reach, the firelight dancing along its dark, hungry edge, making the ancient, baked gore on her armour seem to writhe. A simple wooden bowl of stew rested in her lap. Around her, officers and veterans mingled freely. Lieutenant Aris in conversation with the quartermaster about arrowhead supplies. A grizzled sergeant named Marl was recounting a bawdy tale involving a misplaced keg of ale and a very angry goat, drawing genuine laughter from Khara—a low, rich sound that seemed to surprise even some veterans. She took a bite of bread, her gaze sweeping the campfires, missing nothing: Rolan’s starstruck group, Laora’s quiet vigil by Silas, the tense circle forming around Garrick and Varek.
Hierarchy existed here, but it was the hierarchy of function, not privilege. Orders given during the day were law. But here, by the fire, on the precipice of oblivion, they were all just survivors sharing warmth and stories. Khara understood this intrinsically. To isolate herself would be to fracture the fragile unity that held them together against the dark. She listened more than she spoke, her presence both a comfort and a constant reminder of the stakes. Her eyes, reflecting the firelight like molten bronze, held the weight of centuries of defence, the knowledge of horrors beyond the dunes, and a fierce, protective pride for the ragged, dangerous family gathered in the firelight. She was one of them, yet apart—the lodestone, the myth made flesh, sharing stew under the same vast, star-strewn sky that watched over the monsters and the doomed alike. The fire crackled, sparks spiraling upwards like fleeing embers, illuminating faces etched with weariness, defiance, devotion, and the shared, unspoken understanding that dawn might not find them all breathing. But for tonight, there was stew, fire, and the formidable, crimson-haired legend sitting quietly among her wolves.
