The command still hung in the suddenly thick, ozone-tainted air when the horizon erupted.
It wasn’t a wave, it was a living avalanche. A seething, churning tide of chitin and claw pouring over the low ridge a mile distant, blotting out the  sand with their grotesque silhouettes against the dying sun. The low thrumming became a physical vibration, shaking loose stones on the plateau, resonating in the chests of the defenders. A stench rolled ahead of them—ammonia, rotting meat, and something acrid like burnt plastic.
Khara’s Breakwater Formation snapped into place with lethal precision. Shieldbearers, veterans like weathered oaks, slammed their tower shields into the stony ground at the plateau’s edge, creating a serrated wall of steel. Behind them, rank upon rank of pikemen braced their long, cruel weapons at a downward angle, points glittering like a deadly thicket. Archers, high on the rocky outcrop left of formation, drew back fletchings to ears. On the right flank, Brask’s heavy infantry—men and women encased in plate, wielding greataxes and warhammers—formed a brutal, immovable anchor. Laora’s scouts were already ghosts, melting into the broken terrain.
The first ranks were Skitterlings—dog-sized horrors with too many jointed legs, blade-like forelimbs, and faceted eyes reflecting the firelight. They hit the shield wall like living shrapnel. The crunchy, screeching thuds of the collision were sickening. Shields shuddered, held. Pikes punched down through the press, impaling multiple Skitterlings like grisly kebabs, ichor spraying in viscous arcs. Arrows descended in a whispering death rain pinning smaller monsters, finding the softer joints of larger ones, populating the landscape with their thwipping melody. But for every Skitterling crushed, three more scrambled over its corpse.
Then came Ironbacks—the bulk of the wave, cow-sized beetles covered in overlapping plates of bone-like chitin, low-slung and powerful. They slammed into the shield wall like living battering rams. Shields groaned, buckled in places. Men screamed as spiked limbs punched through gaps, hooked shields, and dragged defenders screaming into the churning mass. The pike hedge thinned visibly. “HOLD THE LINE! PUSH BACK!” roared sergeants, their voices raw against the din. Brask’s flank surged forward like a steel tide, meeting a surge of Ironbacks trying to bypass the main formation. Warhammers crunched through chitin, greataxes sheared through legs. It was brutal, close-quarters slaughter, the air thick with the coppery tang of human blood mixing with the acrid stench of monster ichor.
Khara hadn’t waited for the wall. As the wave crested the distant ridge, she was already moving. Not running, but striding with terrifying purpose down the scree slope, ahead of her own shield wall, towards the densest part of the oncoming tide. The war scythe was no longer held, it became an extension of her fury.
Her first strike wasn’t a swing, it was a release. The scythe blurred in a horizontal arc, a crescent of annihilation. Three Ironbacks charging abreast simply… disintegrated. Chitin exploded like rotten timber, limbs flew like broken twigs, black ichor geysered. She didn’t pause. The scythe, propelled by its own monstrous momentum and her impossible strength, reversed instantly in a vertical backswing. A leaping Skitterling aiming for her head was bisected mid-air. Step-pivot-swing! The blade carved through the legs of an Ironback, sending its massive body crashing forward, crushing smaller monsters beneath it. Step-dodge-thrust! The spike punched through the faceted eye of another beetle, piercing its tiny brain.
She moved like a whirlwind of crimson and dark steel, operating in a sphere of utter destruction. Centrifugal force became her ally, every kill fueled the next swing. Ichor coated her armour, turning the ancient gore into a fresh, dripping horror mask. Her crimson hair was plastered to her skull and shoulders, thick with black sludge. She targeted clusters, knots in the tide, breaking their momentum before they could hit the main line. A group of Acid Spitters—smaller, bulbous creatures rearing up on spindly legs—began to swell their thoraxes. Khara was among them before they could unleash their corrosive bile. The scythe became a blender, reducing them to twitching, leaking sacks. She drew the heavies like a lodestone. A monstrous Razorfiend, taller than a wagon, its body a segmented nightmare of serrated edges and whip-like antennae, surged towards her, ignoring the pikes scraping its flanks. Khara met its charge, ducking under a scything limb that would have felled an oak, and drove the scythe’s spike deep into its underbelly. With a guttural roar that echoed over the battlefield, she heaved, using the haft as a lever, and flipped the massive creature onto its back, crushing a dozen Skitterlings beneath it, decapitating it with the follow-up swing.
Rolan’s starry-eyed awe vanished the moment an Ironback horn punched through the shield next to him, spraying him with his comrade’s blood. He screamed, a raw sound of terror, but Kael’s hand clamped on his shoulder. “EYES FRONT! THRUST!” Borin’s roar beside him was a lifeline. Rolan thrust his spear blindly, felt it jar on chitin, thrust again. It punched through a joint. Black ichor fountained over his hand. He retched, but thrust again. The dream of slaughter was a nightmare, but he was in it.
Silas’ dead eyes ignited with a feral light when a Skitterling scrambled over the shield wall, claws raking towards his face. Laora’s knife flashed, severing a limb, but another claw hooked his vambrace. Without thought, driven by pure, screaming survival, he drove the skinning knife she’d given him upwards, behind the creature’s jaw, just as she’d said. It shrieked, spasmed, and went limp. He ripped the knife free, covered in hot, foul-smelling gore. He didn’t wipe it. He looked for the next target. The numbness was gone, replaced by the terrifying clarity of the kill.
Garrick fought beside Varek, his crooked sword feeling inadequate against the Ironbacks. He saw Varek take a glancing blow from a chitinous limb that would have shattered his own arm. The big man grunted, stumbled, but swung his warhammer with undiminished fury, caving in an Ironback’s head. “STAY CLOSE, DEFIANT!” He bellowed. Garrick saw an opening, ducked under a flailing limb, and drove his sword point into the vulnerable seam where an Ironback’s leg met its body. It screeched and collapsed. Varek finished it with a brutal downward smash. Garrick met veteran gaze. The defiance was still there, but tempered now. He nodded. Varek grinned, a terrifying sight in the chaos. “THAT’S HOW YOU DO IT!”
The formation bent. It didn’t break, but it bent like green wood under immense pressure. The sheer weight of the tide pushed the shield wall back step by agonizing step across the plateau. Gaps opened. Men died. A pike hedge collapsed as a rush of Ironbacks overwhelmed a section. Screams cut short. An archer, overwhelmed by a flanking swarm of Skitterlings that scaled the rocks, went down under a frenzy of blades. Lieutenant Aris, fighting near the command point, saw a Razorfiend antenna whip towards a cluster of reforming shields. He intercepted it with his sword, the force throwing him back, dazed, ribs screaming. They were elite, but the monsters were endless.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, bathing the battlefield in an eerie, bloody twilight, Khara was far from where the main unit now desperately held its ground, yards back from the plateau’s edge. She stood, alone, on the initial slope where she’d met the wave. Around her lay a charnel mound—a small hill comprised solely of dismembered Ironbacks, bisected Razorfiends, and a carpet of shattered Skitterlings. Ichor pooled in lakes, steaming slightly in the cooling air. Her war scythe was still moving, but slower now, the centrifugal fury replaced by grim, efficient slaughter as stragglers and new arrivals tried to overwhelm her.
Finally, the tide broke. Not stopped, but broken. Khara’s relentless assault on the densest clusters, the elimination of key heavies, and the brutal efficiency of her unit had shattered the wave’s cohesion. Instead of a concentrated fist, it became a scattered, disorganized mob. The surviving monsters, perhaps sensing the loss of momentum, perhaps instinctively avoiding the reaper standing amidst her mountain of dead, began to flow around the plateau or break into smaller, manageable groups. The cannons of the distant bastion fort began to thrum, picking off the stragglers. The objective—slaughter most, disperse the rest—was met, though the cost was written in the broken bodies littering the plateau.
Aris, limping, his sword notched and slick with ichor, led a small group of the least wounded back towards the initial slope. The silence, after the hours of hellish noise, was deafening, broken only by moans of the dying and the wet crunch of boots on carapace. There they saw a grotesque ziggurat of death. Then, a gleam. Near the base, catching the last dying embers of light, was the crimson-washed hilt of the war scythe, protruding almost vertically from the carcass of a Razorfiend.
As they climbed the slippery slope of corpses, Aris saw her. Not standing triumphant, but pinned. Khara was on one knee, buried up to her waist in a slurry of gore and shattered chitin. The Razorfiend’s body, impaled by her scythe, lay half-collapsed over her shoulders, its weight pressing down, dripping thick ropes of black and purple ichor onto her head and back. Her war scythe was angled, the blade dug into the ground, the only thing preventing her from being completely submerged. She was utterly still, a statue carved from blood and exhaustion, still holding onto her weapon. Her once-vibrant crimson hair was a solid, muddy mass of black ichor and gore, hanging in thick, grotesque ropes that completely obscured her face. She looked less like a victor and more like a sacrifice offered to the monstrous dead.
Aris approached cautiously, his heart hammering against his bruised ribs. “Commander?” His voice was a rasp.
A low, guttural sound emanated from the gore-covered figure. Not a word. An animal groan of pure effort and spent adrenaline. Then, a red eye snapped open, gleaming with feral intensity from behind the dripping curtain of filthy hair. It locked onto Aris. Recognition flickered, instantly replaced by a fierce, almost offended pride. She needed no help.
With another grinding sound, Khara planted her free hand in the muck and shoved. Simultaneously, she twisted her body and wrenched the scythe sideways with a sickening schlorp. The Razorfiend corpse shifted, rolling partially off her. Still kneeling, buried to her thighs, she braced the scythe again and used it as a lever, hauling one leg, then the other, out of the sucking morass of viscera with a sound like pulling roots from mud.
Finally standing on relatively solid ground—though it was still a carpet of carnage—Khara swayed. Her left leg buckled slightly at the knee. A frustrated, gutteral snarl ripped from her throat, raw and inhuman. She looked down at the offending limb. The knee guard of her armour was crushed and twisted inwards, biting into the joint. Without hesitation, she hooked the spike of her scythe under a mangled strap and yanked. Metal shrieked and tore. She ripped the ruined guard free and flung it aside into the gore with a wet splat. Testing the leg again, she took a step. It held. The limp vanished, replaced by the deliberate, heavy tread of utter exhaustion.
She bent, retrieving her scythe. The blade made a wet, dragging sound as she pulled it free from the Razorfiend. Without a backward glance at the mountain of death she’d built, Khara began to walk, dragging the massive weapon behind her like a farmer dragging a plow at the end of a brutal day. Each step left a smear of black ichor and darker fluids on the churned earth. Her breathing was a ragged sawing sound, audible even yards away. The feral light still burned in her visible eye, the adrenaline refusing to relinquish its grip, but beneath the mask of gore and the animal exhaustion, Lieutenant Aris saw it: the iron core of the Crimson Shield. She walked past him, back towards the shattered remnants of her unit, a blood-drenched goddess dragging the symbol of her grim harvest through the twilight of the dead. Victory, here, smelled only of death and exhaustion.
