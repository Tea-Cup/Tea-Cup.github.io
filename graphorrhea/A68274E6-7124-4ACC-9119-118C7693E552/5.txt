The plateau, once a killing ground, became a landscape of groans and hurried mercy. The monstrous silence shattered not by war-cries, but by the sharp, urgent voices of the medics and the ragged breathing of the wounded.
Groans and smell blended with the medic’s cadence and sounds of care, creating the symphony of aftermath: A low, constant undercurrent of pain—sharp cries when a limb was moved, deep, guttural moans from internal injuries, the wet, rattling breaths of the punctured lung. Sharp, clear commands cut through the din. “Tourniquet! HIGHER! Tighten!” “Pressure here! Hold it! Heavens, hold it!” “Splint this leg! Rag for padding!” “Morphia draught! Quick!” The rip of linen being torn into bandages. The slosh of antiseptic tinctures poured onto gaping wounds, drawing hisses and whimpers. The metallic snick of bone-saws starting their grim work on limbs too shattered to save. The wet suction of chest drains. The rhythmic pump of bellows forcing air into collapsed lungs. Overpowering the fading stench of monster ichor rose the coppery tang of fresh human blood, the sharp bite of medicinal alcohol, the cloying sweetness of infection beginning to bloom, and the sour smell of fear-sweat and exhaustion.
Veterans and the less wounded moved with grim purpose, transformed from killers to carriers. Weapons—notched swords, bent spears, shattered shields—were tossed onto a growing pile near the camp entrance with dull clangs. Armour followed—dented breastplates, torn gambesons, cracked helms—discarded not out of disrespect, but necessity. Unburdened, they became stretcher-bearers. Two men would carefully lift a screaming comrade onto a cloak stretched between spearshafts. Others supported the walking wounded, an arm slung over a shoulder, careful steps over the treacherous, body-littered ground.
Khara sat on a large, bloodstained boulder near the base of her personal charnel mound. Her monstrous scythe was planted point-down in the earth beside her, the haft rising like a grim standard. She was a figure carved from gore and exhaustion. Her head was bowed slightly, her breathing a slow, deep rasp that seemed to echo the plateau’s own weary sigh. Her crimson hair hung in thick, stiffened ropes, plastered to her head and shoulders, completely obscuring her face. Dried ichor cracked like mud on her armour. She didn’t move to help. The sheer effort of walking here had clearly drained her. Yet, her presence was a cornerstone. Warriors carrying the wounded would glance her way, see the silhouette against the rising moon, see the scythe standing defiant, and their steps would firm, their shoulders straighten minutely. She was the embodiment of survival. She had stood where none could, and she still sat, watching over them. A silent promise: We endured. We are still here.
Only when the last groaning stretcher was being carried towards the camp’s flickering medical tents, and the grim task of confirming the dead—a quiet recitation of names, a touch on a cold forehead, the removal of a token—had begun, did Khara stir. With a groan that seemed to rise from the earth itself, she pushed herself off the rock. She gripped the scythe’s haft, using it as a staff, and began the slow, painful trudge back across the ravaged plateau. Each step was deliberate, heavy. Her left leg, though freed of the mangled guard, moved stiffly. She dragged the scythe behind her, its tip scraping a dark line through the sand and gore.
Deep within the camp, away from the bustling medical area and the mournful gathering of the dead, stood a simple, open-sided structure—a wash point. It was little more than a stone-lined pit for runoff, fenced on three sides by rough-hewn timber screens, open to the vast, indifferent desert and the watchful eye of the young, crescent moon. A single torch, jammed into the sand, cast long, dancing shadows.
Here, slumped on a worn log, sat Khara. Her terrifying battle armour lay in a heap beside her, a collapsed shell of dented, gore-caked steel and boiled leather. She was naked, the torchlight revealed a body that was a testament to both superhuman strength and brutal vulnerability. Muscle, corded and powerful even in exhaustion, was mapped with a latticework of scars—white lines from blades, puckered craters from claws, dark bruises blooming like storm clouds across her ribs, shoulders, and thighs. Fresh wounds stood out: gouges on her left forearm where claw had torn through vambrace straps, a nasty puncture high on her right hip, angry red scrapes and contusions everywhere. Her skin was painted in shades of black, purple, and brown—dried ichor, caked blood, and battlefield filth.
Standing over her, holding a large wooden bucket brimming with clean, cold water, was Torvin. He was a mountain of a man, easily the largest in the unit, his shoulders like boulders, his arms thick as young trees. His face, usually set in a permanent, gruff scowl beneath a wild mane of grizzled hair and beard, was uncharacteristically soft. His eyes, small and deep-set, held a profound gentleness as he looked down at his commander.
He didn’t speak. He simply upended the first bucket. The water hit Khara like a physical blow. She gasped, a sharp intake of breath that hissed through clenched teeth, her body tensing violently. The cold deluge sluiced over her head and shoulders, turning the thick mud of her hair into dark rivers that ran down her back and chest, carrying chunks of gore with it. She shuddered, wrapping her arms around herself, not for modesty, but against the shock and the bone-deep cold that followed the draining adrenaline. Her head remained bowed, long crimson strands plastered to her face and neck.
Torvin refilled the bucket from a large cask. The second cascade was less shocking, but she still flinched, a low groan escaping her. He moved methodically, patiently. He used a large, soft sponge, dipping it in a separate basin of water mixed with strong, herbal soap. Starting at her less injured right shoulder, he began to wash her. His touch, despite the size of his hands, was incredibly careful. He avoided fresh wounds, gently working around them. He sponged the thick sludge from her back, the powerful muscles there knotting and relaxing under his touch. He carefully lifted sections of her heavy, wet hair, washing the nape of her neck, the back of her ears.
“We should’ve killed the bulk there,” Khara rasped suddenly, her voice raw and thick. She didn’t look up. “The rest is scattered.” It was a report, confirmation of the objective met.
Torvin grunted, a sound of acknowledgment. He moved to her left arm, his touch feather-light around the deep gouges. “Marl took… bad hit to the leg. Bone showing. Kael… cracked ribs, punctured lung. Stable… maybe.” His voice was a low rumble, like distant thunder, relaying the cost in his sparse way.
Khara shuddered again, a full-body tremor. She hugged herself tighter. “The new ones?”
“Defiant… Garrick fought well. Stabbed an Ironback in the joint, saved Varek’s stubborn hide.” “Eager one… Rolan threw up but kept thrusting.” “Dead-Eyes… Silas used the knife. Stabbed a Skitterling and kept stabbing. Found purpose. Or madness. Hard to tell.” Torvin paused, rinsing the sponge. He poured another bucket carefully over her back, washing away the soap and loosened filth. The water pooled around her feet, dark and foul.
He moved around to her front. Khara didn’t flinch from his gaze now, though her eyes were half-lidded with exhaustion. Torvin knelt, his massive frame making the movement surprisingly graceful. He began washing her legs, the powerful thighs, the stiff left knee that was swollen and bruised purple. His touch remained reverently gentle. He saw the feverish glaze starting in her eyes, the slight tremor in her hands that wasn’t just from cold. The gore, the filth, the physical trauma—it was a poison invading her system.
“Fever coming,” Torvin stated, his gruff voice laced with concern he rarely showed anyone else. He reached for a small, clay jar beside the cask. Inside was a thick, pungent green paste—a healer’s poultice, strong with antiseptic herbs and known febrifuges. He began applying it carefully to her deeper wounds, the gouges on her arm, the puncture on her hip. The paste would draw out poison and fight infection.
Khara hissed as the paste touched a raw edge, but she didn’t pull away. She allowed it. She allowed his ministrations, his silent strength supporting her crumbling physical one. Here, in the torchlight, under the vast desert sky, with only the gentle giant she trusted implicitly, the Steel showed her cracks. She leaned forward slightly, resting her forehead against Torvin’s broad shoulder for just a moment, a gesture of utter exhaustion and implicit trust. He paused in his work, one huge hand coming up to rest very lightly, almost impossibly gently, on the back of her damp, cleanish head.
“Will hold,” Khara muttered, pulling back, straightening with visible effort, the defiance flickering back into her fever-bright eyes. “Always hold.” It was a statement, a promise to herself, to him, to the dying world she shielded.
Torvin just grunted again, but his small eyes held a deep, unwavering certainty. He picked up the sponge once more. There was still much blood to wash away, much filth to remove, before the Commander could rest. And tomorrow, the desert would still be there, waiting. But for now, under the young moon, the strongest warrior in the world sat naked and battered, relying on the gentlest hands in the camp to keep the darkness, both without and within, at bay.
