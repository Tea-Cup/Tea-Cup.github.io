The desert afternoon bled into a smoldering, ochre-hued twilight. The campfires, once islands of warmth and camaraderie, now felt like fragile beacons against the deepening gloom. A tense, expectant hush had settled over the plateau, thicker than the ever-present dust.
Commander Khara sat on her saddle-stone, not eating, not speaking. Her gaze was fixed south, beyond the camp’s perimeter, past the horizon where the land dipped into the true, monster-choked wastes. Her fingers, resting lightly on the haft of her war scythe beside her, were unnervingly still. Then, without preamble, without raising her voice above the murmur of the camp, she spoke. Her words, clear and cold as glacial meltwater, cut through the air like a blade.
“They stir.” Instant silence. Every head snapped towards her. Spoons froze halfway to mouths. Even the crackling fires seemed to hush. “The earth groans under their tread. The air curdles with their hunger.” She didn’t turn, her profile etched against the dying light, crimson hair like a wound against the darkening sky. “A wave. A hungry one.”
Before doubt could even flicker, a frantic drumbeat of hooves shattered the stillness. A scout, his horse lathered and wild-eyed, thundered through the perimeter gate, scattering sentries. He didn’t dismount, just reined in hard before Khara, gasping for breath that tasted of fear and dust.
“Commander! Confirmed!” he rasped, voice raw. “Massive signature… breached the Serpent’s Teeth! They’re shredding through the minefield, moving fast!”
Khara rose. It wasn’t a leisurely movement. It was the unsheathing of a weapon. The easygoing commander who shared stew was gone, shed like a discarded skin. In her place stood the Lodestone of Annihilation, the Goddess of the Crimson Shield. Every line of her body radiated terrifying purpose. The ancient gore on her armour seemed to pulse in the fading light.
“As usual,” her voice, still not loud, now carried the weight of tectonic plates grinding. It brooked no question, filled the entire camp. “We are the spearhead. We do not stop the wave. We break it. Slaughter as much as you, rend their cohesion, scatter the remnants like chaff for the bastion to grind to dust. Anything less is failure! Move, people!”
The camp didn’t erupt—it detonated. A roar, not of fear, but of grim acceptance and unleashed fury, tore from a hundred throats. The brief, stunned silence shattered into a symphony of controlled chaos:
Veterans were already moving, years of brutal instinct taking over. Armour plates slammed shut with finality—buckles cinched tight, gorgets fastened, vambraces locked. Swords hissed from scabbards for a final, ritualistic check before being slammed home. Spears were snatched from racks, their points catching the last bloody rays of the sun. A Clangor of Steel.
Sergeants’ voices barked orders, sharp and precise as cracking whips. “Archers! Full quivers! Incendiaries primed!” “Shield wall! Check overlaps! Pike hedge, form up on Marl!” “Medic stations! Scalpels sharp, tourniquets ready!” Blacksmiths, who moments ago were dousing forges, now frantically hammered dents out of shield rims or riveted loose pauldrons. A Chorus of Preparation.
The air vibrated with urgency. Men sprinted to supply wagons, grabbing extra bandoliers of throwing axes, sacks of caltrops, pots of vile-smelling alchemical paste meant for blinding larger horrors. Water skins were filled to bursting. Horses were saddled with for the scouts and messengers. A Thrum of Purpose.
Rolan fumbled with his buckles, his face pale but eyes blazing with terrified determination, Kael and Borin flanking him, barking quick instructions on formation spacing. Laora shoved a small, sharp skinning knife into Silas’s unresisting hand. “Stick ’em in the soft bits behind the jaw,” she hissed, her own eyes narrowed to slits, scanning the southern horizon. “Just keep stabbing.” Silas looked at the knife, then south, the deadness in his eyes momentarily replaced by a flicker of primal understanding. Garrick stood amidst Varek’s group, tightening the straps on his battered vambraces. Varek clapped a massive hand on his shoulder—not friendly, but acknowledging. “Try not to trip over yourself out there, pup. Stick close. Kill anything that ain’t human.” Garrick met his gaze and gave a single, sharp nod. Newcomers’ Baptism.
Khara moved through the maelstrom like the eye of a hurricane. Her presence was a command in itself. Gone was any semblance of casual interaction. Her eyes, hard and luminous as desert iron under the deepening twilight, scanned everything—the alignment of a shield wall, the tension on a bowstring, the frantic pace of the medics preparing their grisly tools.
She reached the command post—a large, sand-scoured map table near the southern edge of the camp. Senior officers converged instantly. Her finger stabbed down onto the map, tracing a jagged line just beyond the visible horizon where the scout had pointed. “Breakwater formation. Here. We meet them on the scree slope. Archers on the high ridge—fire for saturation, then switch to precision. Shield wall anchors the center. Pikes behind, not in front. They break on the shields, then you impale.” Her gaze swept the officers. “Brask. Your heavy infantry flank the right. Crush anything that tries to bypass. Laora. Scouts dispersed around, keep us posted about flanks… and anything new.” Her voice held a particular edge on ’new’. “The scythe,” she said, and it wasn’t bragging, it was a statement of tactical fact, “goes where the wave is thickest. Follow the crimson.”
The orders flowed, cold, precise, leaving no room for ambiguity. She wasn’t just commanding, she was orchestrating violence on an industrial scale. The easygoing demeanor was a memory. This was Khara the Steel, fully manifest.
As the final orders snapped out, she turned from the table. The monstrous war scythe was already in her hand, no longer resting, but held loosely, ready. She walked towards the forming ranks at the southern perimeter. Below, in the gathering darkness beyond the plateau’s edge, a low, subsonic tremor began to pulse through the earth. It wasn’t sound, but a feeling—a vast, terrible weight shifting, moving closer. The horizon itself seemed to writhe, not with heat haze anymore, but with the seething, chitinous shadow of the approaching wave.
The sun was a molten sliver on the horizon. Khara stopped at the very edge of the plateau, her crimson hair lashing like a battle standard in the suddenly hot, stinking wind blowing from the south. She raised the scythe, the dark blade drinking the last light, pointing it towards the encroaching tide of nightmares. Her voice, amplified by the strange acoustics of the plateau and her own terrifying presence, rolled over her troops one last time, a clarion call before the abyss:
“FORWARD! FOR THE DAWN YOU MAY NEVER SEE! FOR THE BREATH IN YOUR LUNGS! MAKE! THEM! BLEED!”
